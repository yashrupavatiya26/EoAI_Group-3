2,DeepSeek-Math-7B,2,17,Three fair coins are flipped. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 heads?,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and combinations. 

When flipping three coins, there are 8 possible outcomes, since each coin can land in two ways (heads or tails), and there are three coins. These outcomes are: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT.

We are interested in the event of getting exactly 2 heads. This can happen in three ways: HHT, HTH, and THH.

So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. 

In this case, the probability of getting exactly 2 heads is the number of favorable outcomes (3) divided by the total number of outcomes (8).

So, the probability is $\frac{3}{8}$.

1. Probability of obtaining 2 heads:
There are 3 ways to obtain 2 heads: HHT, HTH, and THH. Each of these outcomes has a probability of 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.144. Since there are 3 such outcomes, the total probability of obtaining 2 heads is 3 * 0.144 = 0.432.

2. Probability of obtaining 3 heads:
There is only 1 way to obtain 3 heads: HHH. This outcome has a probability of 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.216.

Adding the probabilities of obtaining 2 heads and 3 heads, we get the total probability of obtaining at least 2 heads: 0.432 + 0.216 = 0.648.

Now, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that the definite integral of a function from $a$ to $b$ is equal to the antiderivative evaluated at $b$ minus the antiderivative evaluated at $a$.

So, we have:

$\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \left[\frac{1}{3}x^3\right]_0^1$

Now, we evaluate the antiderivative at the bounds of integration:

$\left[\frac{1}{3}x^3\right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3}(1)^3 - \frac{1}{3}(0)^3 = \frac{1}{3} - 0 = \frac{1}{3}$

Now, we can use the given information that $\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = 1/3$. Since the interval of integration is from 0 to 1, we can rewrite the integral as:

$$\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}$$

We want to find the integral from 0 to 2, so we need to adjust the interval of integration. We can do this by splitting the integral into two parts:

$$\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx + \int_1^2 x^2 \, dx$$

We know that $\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = 1/3$, so we need to find $\int_1^2 x^2 \, dx$. We can use the property of linearity to rewrite this integral as:

$$\int_1^2 x^2 \, dx = \int_0^2 x^2 \, dx - \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx$$

Substituting the known values, we get:

$$\int_1^2 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = 0$$

The determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of its diagonal elements. So, we have:

Expanding the equation, we get:

(2 - λ)((-1) - λ)(3 - λ) = (2 - λ)(3 - λ) - (2 - λ)((-1) - λ) = 0

In our case, a = 2. We can solve this equation using the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is given by the exponential of the integral of the coefficient a with respect to the independent variable t. In this case, the integrating factor is e^(∫2 dt) = e^(2t).

Now, we multiply the entire differential equation by the integrating factor e^(2t):

e^(2t)y' + 2e^(2t)y = 0

The left-hand side of this equation is now the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor:

There is only 1 outcome where all 3 coins land on tails, so the probability of getting all tails is 1/8.

P(X \ge 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)
P(X \ge 1) = 1 - 1/8

Mean = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5

Next, we need to find the squared difference between each value and the mean, and then find the average of these squared differences.

Squared differences: (1 - 2.5)^2 = 2.25, (2 - 2.5)^2 = 0.25, (3 - 2.5)^2 = 0.25, (4 - 2.5)^2 = 2.25

Average of squared differences = (2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25

Therefore, the population variance is 1.25.","A data set consists of the values [1, 2, 3, 4] with population variance 1.25. A new data set is formed by adding 5 to every value, giving [6, 7, 8, 9]. Without recomputing all deviations, determine the population variance of the new data set.","To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of variance in statistics. The variance of a data set is a measure of how spread out the data is. It is calculated as the average of the squared deviations from the mean.

Given a data set with values [1, 2, 3, 4] and a population variance of 1.25, we can calculate the mean of the data set as:

Mean = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5

Now, let's consider the new data set formed by adding 5 to every value, giving [6, 7, 8, 9]. The mean of this new data set is:

Mean = (6 + 7 + 8 + 9) / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5

Notice that the mean of the new data set is 5 more than the mean of the original data set. This is because we added 5 to every value in the original data set.

Now, let's calculate the population variance of the new data set. Since we are adding a constant value (5) to each value in the original data set, the variance of the new data set will be the same as the variance of the original data set. This is because adding a constant value to each value in a data set does not change the spread of the data.

Therefore, the population variance of the new data set is 1.25.",2,3,5,"{""correctness"": ""The answer of 1.25 is fully correct.
