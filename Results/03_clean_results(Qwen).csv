0,Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct,"Let A be the 2×2 matrix A = [[2, 1], [1, 2]]. Find all eigenvalues of A.","To find the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} \), we need to solve the characteristic equation \(\det(A - \lambda I) = 0\), where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue.

First, we compute \( A - \lambda I \):
\[
A - \lambda I = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} \lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 - \lambda & 1 \\ 1 & 2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the determinant of \( A - \lambda I \):
\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 2 - \lambda & 1 \\ 1 & 2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (2 - \lambda)(2 - \lambda) - (1)(1) = (2 - \lambda)^2 - 1.
\]

We set the determinant equal to zero to find the eigenvalues:
\[
(2 - \lambda)^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:
\[
(2 - \lambda - 1)(2 - \lambda + 1) = 0.
\]

Simplifying the factors, we get:
\[
(1 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) = 0.
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the eigenvalues:
\[
1 - \lambda = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 3 - \lambda = 0,
\]
\[
\lambda = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda = 3.
\]

Therefore, the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A \) are \(\boxed{1 \text{ and } 3}\).",37.047,454,12.25

The characteristic equation for a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation of the form \( ay'' + by' + cy = 0 \) is given by:

\[ ar^2 + br + c = 0 \]

For our differential equation \( y'' + 4y' + 4y = 0 \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = 4 \). Substituting these values into the characteristic equation, we get:

\[ r^2 + 4r + 4 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it by factoring. Notice that the left-hand side of the equation can be written as a perfect square:

\[ (r + 2)^2 = 0 \]

Setting the factor equal to zero gives:

\[ r + 2 = 0 \]

Solving for \( r \), we get:

\[ r = -2 \]

Since the characteristic equation has a repeated root \( r = -2 \), the general solution to the differential equation is given by:

\[ y(t) = C_1 e^{-2t} + C_2 t e^{-2t} \]

where \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are constants determined by initial conditions. Therefore, the general solution is:

2,Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct,Three fair coins are flipped. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 heads?,"To determine the probability of getting exactly 2 heads when three fair coins are flipped, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   Each coin has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails). Since the coins are flipped independently, the total number of possible outcomes when flipping three coins is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8

   The possible outcomes are: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT.

2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**
   We need to count the number of outcomes that have exactly 2 heads. These outcomes are: HHT, HTH, THH. There are 3 such outcomes.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 2 heads is:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{3}{8}

2. **Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper and lower limits of integration:**
   We need to evaluate \(\frac{x^3}{3}\) at \(x = 1\) and at \(x = 0\).

Given the matrix \( B \):
\[
B = \begin{pmatrix}
2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 \\

1. **Identify the type of differential equation:**
   The given equation is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation.

2. **Assume a solution of the form \( y = e^{rt} \):**
   For linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, we assume a solution of the form \( y = e^{rt} \), where \( r \) is a constant to be determined.

3. **Find the derivative \( y' \):**
   If \( y = e^{rt} \), then the derivative \( y' \) is:
   \[
   y' = r e^{rt}

   \[
   r e^{rt} + 2 e^{rt} = 0

5. **Factor out \( e^{rt} \):**
   Since \( e^{rt} \neq 0 \) for any real \( t \), we can factor \( e^{rt} \) out of the equation:

6. **Solve for \( r \):**

   \]
   The possible outcomes are: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT.

2. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes for \( X \ge 1 \):**
   Instead of counting the number of outcomes where we get at least 1 head directly, it is easier to count the number of outcomes where we get 0 heads (i.e., all tails) and subtract this from the total number of outcomes.
   - The outcome where we get 0 heads is TTT.
   - There is only 1 outcome where we get 0 heads.
   - Therefore, the number of outcomes where we get at least 1 head is:

Since the die is fair, each face has an equal probability of landing face up. Therefore, the probability \( P(X = k) \) for each \( k \) from 1 to 6 is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

The expected value \( E[X] \) is given by the formula:

\[ y'(t) = c_2 e^{-2t} + (c_1 + c_2 t) (-2) e^{-2t} \]
\[ y'(t) = c_2 e^{-2t} - 2c_1 e^{-2t} - 2c_2 t e^{-2t} \]
\[ y'(t) = (c_2 - 2c_1 - 2c_2 t) e^{-2t} \]

Now, we apply the initial condition \( y'(0) = 0 \):

\[ y'(0) = (c_2 - 2c_1 - 2c_2 \cdot 0) e^{-2 \cdot 0} = (c_2 - 2c_1) \cdot 1 = c_2 - 2c_1 \]

So, we have:

\[ c_2 - 2c_1 = 0 \]

Since \( c_1 = 1 \), we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ c_2 - 2 \cdot 1 = 0 \]
\[ c_2 - 2 = 0 \]
\[ c_2 = 2 \]

Therefore, the unique solution satisfying the initial conditions is:

\[ y(t) = (1 + 2t) e^{-2t} \]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{(1 + 2t) e^{-2t}}

17,Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct,"Three biased coins are flipped, each showing heads with probability 0.6 and tails with probability 0.4, independently. What is the probability of obtaining at least 2 heads?","To find the probability of obtaining at least 2 heads when three biased coins are flipped, we need to consider the probabilities of getting exactly 2 heads and exactly 3 heads. We will use the binomial probability formula for this calculation. The binomial probability formula is given by:

\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]

where \( n \) is the number of trials (in this case, 3), \( k \) is the number of successful trials (heads), \( p \) is the probability of success on an individual trial (0.6), and \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) successes out of \( n \) trials.

First, we calculate the probability of getting exactly 2 heads:

\[ P(X = 2) = \binom{3}{2} (0.6)^2 (0.4)^{3-2} = 3 \cdot (0.6)^2 \cdot (0.4)^1 = 3 \cdot 0.36 \cdot 0.4 = 3 \cdot 0.144 = 0.432 \]

Next, we calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 heads:

\[ P(X = 3) = \binom{3}{3} (0.6)^3 (0.4)^{3-3} = 1 \cdot (0.6)^3 \cdot (0.4)^0 = 1 \cdot 0.216 \cdot 1 = 0.216 \]

The probability of getting at least 2 heads is the sum of the probabilities of getting exactly 2 heads and exactly 3 heads:

\[ P(X \geq 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 0.432 + 0.216 = 0.648 \]

Therefore, the probability of obtaining at least 2 heads is:

\[ \boxed{0.648} \]",37.372,457,12.23
18,Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct,"Suppose you already know that \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = 1/3. Using this or otherwise, compute \int_0^2 4x^2 \, dx without re-integrating from scratch.","To compute \(\int_0^2 4x^2 \, dx\) without re-integrating from scratch, we can use the properties of integrals. Specifically, we can use the fact that the integral of a constant times a function is the constant times the integral of the function. This property can be written as:

\[
\int_a^b c f(x) \, dx = c \int_a^b f(x) \, dx
\]

In this problem, the function is \(4x^2\) and the constant is 4. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:

\[
\int_0^2 4x^2 \, dx = 4 \int_0^2 x^2 \, dx
\]

Next, we need to evaluate \(\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx\). We can do this by breaking it down into two parts: from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 2. This is because the integral from 0 to 2 is the sum of the integral from 0 to 1 and the integral from 1 to 2:

\[
\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx + \int_1^2 x^2 \, dx
\]

We already know that \(\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}\). Now, we need to evaluate \(\int_1^2 x^2 \, dx\). We can use the substitution \(u = x - 1\), which transforms the integral as follows:

\[
\int_1^2 x^2 \, dx = \int_0^1 (u + 1)^2 \, du
\]

Expanding the integrand, we get:

\[
\int_0^1 (u + 1)^2 \, du = \int_0^1 (u^2 + 2u + 1) \, du
\]

We can split this integral into three separate integrals:

\[
\int_0^1 (u^2 + 2u + 1) \, du = \int_0^1 u^2 \, du + \int_0^1 2u \, du + \int_0^1 1 \, du
\]

Evaluating each integral separately, we get:

\[
\int_0^1 u^2 \, du = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\int_0^1 2u \, du = 2 \int_0^1 u \, du = 2 \left[ \frac{u^2}{2} \right]_0^1 = 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} - 0 \right) = 1
\]
\[
\int_0^1 1 \, du = \left[ u \right]_0^1 = 1 - 0 = 1
\]

Adding these results together, we get:

\[
\int_0^1 (u^2 + 2u + 1) \, du = \frac{1}{3} + 1 + 1 = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{3}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{7}{3}
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx + \int_1^2 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

Now, we can substitute this result back into our expression for \(\int_0^2 4x^2 \, dx\):

\[
\int_0^2 4x^2 \, dx = 4 \int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = 4 \left( \frac{8}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{3}
\]

Thus, the value of the integral is:

Using the original mean 4, compute the corrected mean of the remaining four data points without recomputing all the sums from scratch.","To find the corrected mean of the remaining four data points after removing the outlier, we can use the information given about the original mean. Here are the steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the original data set:**
   The original mean is given as 4, and there are 5 data points in the original set. Therefore, the sum of the original data set is:
   \[
   \text{Sum of original data set} = \text{Mean} \times \text{Number of data points} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

2. **Determine the sum of the remaining data set:**
   Since the value 10 was removed, we subtract 10 from the sum of the original data set to get the sum of the remaining four data points:
   \[
   \text{Sum of remaining data set} = 20 - 10 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the corrected mean:**
   The corrected mean is the sum of the remaining data set divided by the number of remaining data points, which is 4:
   \[

Without computing any matrix inverses explicitly, find all eigenvalues of C.","Given that \( B \) is a \( 3 \times 3 \) matrix with eigenvalues 2, -1, and 3, we need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix \( C = B^{-1} + I \).

First, recall that if \( \lambda \) is an eigenvalue of \( B \), then there exists a non-zero vector \( \mathbf{v} \) such that:
\[ B \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v} \]

We need to find the eigenvalues of \( C = B^{-1} + I \). Let \( \mu \) be an eigenvalue of \( C \). Then there exists a non-zero vector \( \mathbf{v} \) such that:
\[ C \mathbf{v} = \mu \mathbf{v} \]
Substituting \( C = B^{-1} + I \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B^{-1} + I) \mathbf{v} = \mu \mathbf{v} \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ B^{-1} \mathbf{v} + I \mathbf{v} = \mu \mathbf{v} \]
\[ B^{-1} \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v} = \mu \mathbf{v} \]
\[ B^{-1} \mathbf{v} = (\mu - 1) \mathbf{v} \]

This tells us that \( \mu - 1 \) is an eigenvalue of \( B^{-1} \). Since the eigenvalues of \( B \) are 2, -1, and 3, the eigenvalues of \( B^{-1} \) are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( B^{-1} \) are \( \frac{1}{2} \), -1, and \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( C \) are:
\[ \mu - 1 = \frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \mu - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2 \]
\[ \mu - 1 = \frac{1}{3} - 1 = -\frac{2}{3} \]

Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( C \) are:

Now consider the nonhomogeneous equation z' + 2z = 6 with initial condition z(0) = 0. Use the structure of the homogeneous solution or an integrating factor to find z(t).,"To solve the nonhomogeneous differential equation \( z' + 2z = 6 \) with the initial condition \( z(0) = 0 \), we can use the method of integrating factors. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the integrating factor:**
   The integrating factor for a first-order linear differential equation of the form \( z' + P(t)z = Q(t) \) is given by \( \mu(t) = e^{\int P(t) \, dt} \). In this equation, \( P(t) = 2 \) and \( Q(t) = 6 \). Therefore, the integrating factor is:
   \[
   \mu(t) = e^{\int 2 \, dt} = e^{2t}
   \]

2. **Multiply the differential equation by the integrating factor:**
   Multiplying both sides of the equation \( z' + 2z = 6 \) by \( e^{2t} \) gives:
   \[
   e^{2t}z' + 2e^{2t}z = 6e^{2t}
   \]
   The left-hand side of this equation can be rewritten as the derivative of the product \( e^{2t}z \):
   \[
   \frac{d}{dt}(e^{2t}z) = 6e^{2t}
   \]

3. **Integrate both sides with respect to \( t \):**
   Integrating both sides of the equation \( \frac{d}{dt}(e^{2t}z) = 6e^{2t} \) with respect to \( t \) gives:
   \[
   e^{2t}z = \int 6e^{2t} \, dt
   \]
   The integral on the right-hand side is:
   \[
   \int 6e^{2t} \, dt = 3e^{2t} + C
   \]
   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   e^{2t}z = 3e^{2t} + C
   \]

4. **Solve for \( z(t) \):**
   Dividing both sides of the equation \( e^{2t}z = 3e^{2t} + C \) by \( e^{2t} \) gives:
   \[
   z(t) = 3 + Ce^{-2t}
   \]

5. **Apply the initial condition:**
   We are given the initial condition \( z(0) = 0 \). Substituting \( t = 0 \) into the general solution \( z(t) = 3 + Ce^{-2t} \) gives:
   \[
   z(0) = 3 + Ce^{-2 \cdot 0} = 3 + C = 0
   \]
   Solving for \( C \) gives:
   \[
   C = -3
   \]

6. **Write the particular solution:**
   Substituting \( C = -3 \) back into the general solution \( z(t) = 3 + Ce^{-2t} \) gives the particular solution:
   \[
   z(t) = 3 - 3e^{-2t}

The linearity of expectation states that for any random variables \( Y \) and \( Z \) and any constants \( a \) and \( b \), \( E[aY + bZ] = aE[Y] + bE[Z] \). In this case, we can apply it to \( E[2X - 1] \) as follows:

\[
E[2X - 1] = E[2X] - E[1]
\]

Since \( E[1] = 1 \), we have:

\[
E[2X - 1] = E[2X] - 1
\]

Next, we use the property of expectation that \( E[aX] = aE[X] \). Therefore, we have:

\[
E[2X] = 2E[X]
\]

So, substituting this back into our equation, we get:

\[
E[2X - 1] = 2E[X] - 1
\]

Now, we need to find \( E[X] \). Since \( X \) is a Binomial(3, 0.5) random variable, the expected value of a Binomial random variable \( \text{Binomial}(n, p) \) is given by \( E[X] = np \). Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( p = 0.5 \), so:

Substituting \(y_i = x_i + 5\) and \(\mu_y = \mu_x + 5\) into the formula, we get:

Looking at the ordered list [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9], we see that the 7th value is 6 and the 8th value is 7. Therefore, the median of the new data set is the average of 6 and 7, which is:

\[
\frac{6 + 7}{2} = \frac{13}{2} = 6.5
\]

Thus, the median of the new data set is \(\boxed{6.5}\).",28.916,355,12.28
