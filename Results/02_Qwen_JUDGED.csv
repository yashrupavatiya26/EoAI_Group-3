Find all eigenvalues of A.","To find the eigenvalues of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} \), we need to solve the characteristic equation \(\det(A - \lambda I) = 0\), where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue.

First, we compute \( A - \lambda I \):
\[
A - \lambda I = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} \lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 - \lambda & 1 \\ 1 & 2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the determinant of \( A - \lambda I \):
\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 2 - \lambda & 1 \\ 1 & 2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (2 - \lambda)(2 - \lambda) - (1)(1) = (2 - \lambda)^2 - 1.
\]

We set the determinant equal to zero to find the eigenvalues:
\[
(2 - \lambda)^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:
\[
(2 - \lambda - 1)(2 - \lambda + 1) = 0.
\]

Simplifying the factors, we get:
\[
(1 - \lambda)(3 - \lambda) = 0.

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the eigenvalues:
\[
1 - \lambda = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 3 - \lambda = 0,

Given that the eigenvalues of \(A\) are 1 and 3, we can find the eigenvalues of \(B\) by applying the transformation \(\lambda^2 + 3\) to each eigenvalue of \(A\).

1. For the eigenvalue \(\lambda = 1\):
   \[

Give the general solution.,"To solve the differential equation \( y'' + 4y' + 4y = 0 \), we start by finding the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation of the form \( ay'' + by' + cy = 0 \) is given by:

\[ ar^2 + br + c = 0 \]

For our differential equation \( y'' + 4y' + 4y = 0 \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = 4 \). Substituting these values into the characteristic equation, we get:

\[ r^2 + 4r + 4 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it by factoring. Notice that the left-hand side of the equation can be written as a perfect square:

\[ (r + 2)^2 = 0 \]

Setting the factor equal to zero gives:

\[ r + 2 = 0 \]

Solving for \( r \), we get:

\[ r = -2 \]

Since the characteristic equation has a repeated root \( r = -2 \), the general solution to the differential equation is given by:

\[ y(t) = C_1 e^{-2t} + C_2 t e^{-2t} \]

where \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are constants determined by initial conditions. Therefore, the general solution is:

This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it by factoring:

\[ (r + 2)^2 = 0 \]

The roots of the characteristic equation are:

\[ r = -2 \quad \text{(with multiplicity 2)} \]

Since the characteristic equation has a repeated real root, the differential equation is **critical damped**.

Next, we find the general solution to the differential equation. For a critical damped system, the general solution is given by:

\[ y(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t) e^{-\alpha t} \]

where \( \alpha \) is the repeated root. In this case, \( \alpha = 2 \). Therefore, the general solution is:

\[ y(t) = (c_1 + c_2 t) e^{-2t} \]

We need to find the unique solution satisfying the initial conditions \( y(0) = 1 \) and \( y'(0) = 0 \). First, we apply the initial condition \( y(0) = 1 \):

\[ y(0) = (c_1 + c_2 \cdot 0) e^{-2 \cdot 0} = c_1 \cdot 1 = c_1 \]

So, we have:

\[ c_1 = 1 \]

Next, we find the derivative of \( y(t) \):

\[ y'(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \left[ (c_1 + c_2 t) e^{-2t} \right] \]

Using the product rule, we get:

\[ y'(t) = c_2 e^{-2t} + (c_1 + c_2 t) (-2) e^{-2t} \]
\[ y'(t) = c_2 e^{-2t} - 2c_1 e^{-2t} - 2c_2 t e^{-2t} \]
\[ y'(t) = (c_2 - 2c_1 - 2c_2 t) e^{-2t} \]

Now, we apply the initial condition \( y'(0) = 0 \):

\[ y'(0) = (c_2 - 2c_1 - 2c_2 \cdot 0) e^{-2 \cdot 0} = (c_2 - 2c_1) \cdot 1 = c_2 - 2c_1 \]

So, we have:

\[ c_2 - 2c_1 = 0 \]

Since \( c_1 = 1 \), we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ c_2 - 2 \cdot 1 = 0 \]
\[ c_2 - 2 = 0 \]
\[ c_2 = 2 \]

Therefore, the unique solution satisfying the initial conditions is:

2,Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct,2,17,Three fair coins are flipped. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 heads?,"To determine the probability of getting exactly 2 heads when three fair coins are flipped, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   Each coin has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails). Since the coins are flipped independently, the total number of possible outcomes when flipping three coins is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8
   \]
   The possible outcomes are: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT.

2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**
   We need to count the number of outcomes that have exactly 2 heads. These outcomes are: HHT, HTH, THH. There are 3 such outcomes.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 2 heads is:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{3}{8}
   \]

Thus, the probability of getting exactly 2 heads when three fair coins are flipped is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{8}}\).","Three biased coins are flipped, each showing heads with probability 0.6 and tails with probability 0.4, independently. What is the probability of obtaining at least 2 heads?","To find the probability of obtaining at least 2 heads when three biased coins are flipped, we need to consider the probabilities of getting exactly 2 heads and exactly 3 heads. We will use the binomial probability formula for this calculation. The binomial probability formula is given by:

\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]

where \( n \) is the number of trials (in this case, 3), \( k \) is the number of successful trials (heads), \( p \) is the probability of success on an individual trial (0.6), and \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) successes out of \( n \) trials.

First, we calculate the probability of getting exactly 2 heads:

\[ P(X = 2) = \binom{3}{2} (0.6)^2 (0.4)^{3-2} = 3 \cdot (0.6)^2 \cdot (0.4)^1 = 3 \cdot 0.36 \cdot 0.4 = 3 \cdot 0.144 = 0.432 \]

Next, we calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 heads:

\[ P(X = 3) = \binom{3}{3} (0.6)^3 (0.4)^{3-3} = 1 \cdot (0.6)^3 \cdot (0.4)^0 = 1 \cdot 0.216 \cdot 1 = 0.216 \]

The probability of getting at least 2 heads is the sum of the probabilities of getting exactly 2 heads and exactly 3 heads:

\[ P(X \geq 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) = 0.432 + 0.216 = 0.648 \]

3,Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct,3,18,"Compute the definite integral \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx.","To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx\), we follow these steps:

1. **Find the antiderivative of the integrand \(x^2\):**
   The antiderivative of \(x^2\) is \(\frac{x^3}{3}\). This is because the derivative of \(\frac{x^3}{3}\) is \(x^2\).

2. **Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper and lower limits of integration:**
   We need to evaluate \(\frac{x^3}{3}\) at \(x = 1\) and at \(x = 0\).
   - At \(x = 1\), \(\frac{x^3}{3} = \frac{1^3}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\).
   - At \(x = 0\), \(\frac{x^3}{3} = \frac{0^3}{3} = 0\).

3. **Subtract the value of the antiderivative at the lower limit from the value at the upper limit:**
   \[
   \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \left. \frac{x^3}{3} \right|_0^1 = \frac{1}{3} - 0 = \frac{1}{3}

Therefore, the value of the definite integral is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","Suppose you already know that \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = 1/3. Using this or otherwise, compute \int_0^2 4x^2 \, dx without re-integrating from scratch.","To compute \(\int_0^2 4x^2 \, dx\) without re-integrating from scratch, we can use the properties of integrals. Specifically, we can use the fact that the integral of a constant times a function is the constant times the integral of the function. This property can be written as:

\[
\int_a^b c f(x) \, dx = c \int_a^b f(x) \, dx
\]

In this problem, the function is \(4x^2\) and the constant is 4. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:

\[
\int_0^2 4x^2 \, dx = 4 \int_0^2 x^2 \, dx
\]

Next, we need to evaluate \(\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx\). We can do this by breaking it down into two parts: from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 2. This is because the integral from 0 to 2 is the sum of the integral from 0 to 1 and the integral from 1 to 2:

\[
\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx + \int_1^2 x^2 \, dx
\]

We already know that \(\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}\). Now, we need to evaluate \(\int_1^2 x^2 \, dx\). We can use the substitution \(u = x - 1\), which transforms the integral as follows:

\[
\int_1^2 x^2 \, dx = \int_0^1 (u + 1)^2 \, du
\]

Expanding the integrand, we get:

\[
\int_0^1 (u + 1)^2 \, du = \int_0^1 (u^2 + 2u + 1) \, du
\]

We can split this integral into three separate integrals:

\[
\int_0^1 (u^2 + 2u + 1) \, du = \int_0^1 u^2 \, du + \int_0^1 2u \, du + \int_0^1 1 \, du
\]

Evaluating each integral separately, we get:

\[
\int_0^1 u^2 \, du = \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[
\int_0^1 2u \, du = 2 \int_0^1 u \, du = 2 \left[ \frac{u^2}{2} \right]_0^1 = 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} - 0 \right) = 1
\]
\[
\int_0^1 1 \, du = \left[ u \right]_0^1 = 1 - 0 = 1
\]

Adding these results together, we get:

\[
\int_0^1 (u^2 + 2u + 1) \, du = \frac{1}{3} + 1 + 1 = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{3}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{7}{3}
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \int_0^1 x^2 \, dx + \int_1^2 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{7}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

Now, we can substitute this result back into our expression for \(\int_0^2 4x^2 \, dx\):

\[
\int_0^2 4x^2 \, dx = 4 \int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = 4 \left( \frac{8}{3} \right) = \frac{32}{3}

\[ B^{-1} \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v} = \mu \mathbf{v} \]
\[ B^{-1} \mathbf{v} = (\mu - 1) \mathbf{v} \]

   For linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, we assume a solution of the form \( y = e^{rt} \), where \( r \) is a constant to be determined.

3. **Find the derivative \( y' \):**
   If \( y = e^{rt} \), then the derivative \( y' \) is:
   \[
   y' = r e^{rt}
   \]

4. **Substitute \( y \) and \( y' \) into the differential equation:**
   Substitute \( y = e^{rt} \) and \( y' = r e^{rt} \) into the equation \( y' + 2y = 0 \):
   \[
   r e^{rt} + 2 e^{rt} = 0
   \]

5. **Factor out \( e^{rt} \):**
   Since \( e^{rt} \neq 0 \) for any real \( t \), we can factor \( e^{rt} \) out of the equation:
   \[
   e^{rt} (r + 2) = 0
   \]

6. **Solve for \( r \):**
   Set the factor \( r + 2 \) equal to zero:
   \[
   r + 2 = 0
   \]
   Solving for \( r \), we get:
   \[
   r = -2
   \]

7. **Write the general solution:**
   Since \( r = -2 \), the solution to the differential equation is:
   \[
   y = e^{-2t}
   \]

8. **Consider the general form of the solution:**
   For a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation, the general solution is a constant multiple of the particular solution. Therefore, the general solution is:
   \[
   y(t) = C e^{-2t}
   \]
   where \( C \) is an arbitrary constant.

Thus, the general solution to the differential equation \( y' + 2y = 0 \) is:
\[
\boxed{y(t) = C e^{-2t}}
\]",Consider the homogeneous differential equation y' + 2y = 0 with general solution y(t) = C e^{-2t}. Now consider the nonhomogeneous equation z' + 2z = 6 with initial condition z(0) = 0. Use the structure of the homogeneous solution or an integrating factor to find z(t).,"To solve the nonhomogeneous differential equation \( z' + 2z = 6 \) with the initial condition \( z(0) = 0 \), we can use the method of integrating factors. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the integrating factor:**
   The integrating factor for a first-order linear differential equation of the form \( z' + P(t)z = Q(t) \) is given by \( \mu(t) = e^{\int P(t) \, dt} \). In this equation, \( P(t) = 2 \) and \( Q(t) = 6 \). Therefore, the integrating factor is:
   \[
   \mu(t) = e^{\int 2 \, dt} = e^{2t}
   \]

2. **Multiply the differential equation by the integrating factor:**
   Multiplying both sides of the equation \( z' + 2z = 6 \) by \( e^{2t} \) gives:
   \[
   e^{2t}z' + 2e^{2t}z = 6e^{2t}
   \]
   The left-hand side of this equation can be rewritten as the derivative of the product \( e^{2t}z \):
   \[
   \frac{d}{dt}(e^{2t}z) = 6e^{2t}
   \]

3. **Integrate both sides with respect to \( t \):**
   Integrating both sides of the equation \( \frac{d}{dt}(e^{2t}z) = 6e^{2t} \) with respect to \( t \) gives:
   \[
   e^{2t}z = \int 6e^{2t} \, dt
   \]
   The integral on the right-hand side is:
   \[
   \int 6e^{2t} \, dt = 3e^{2t} + C
   \]
   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   e^{2t}z = 3e^{2t} + C
   \]

4. **Solve for \( z(t) \):**
   Dividing both sides of the equation \( e^{2t}z = 3e^{2t} + C \) by \( e^{2t} \) gives:
   \[
   z(t) = 3 + Ce^{-2t}
   \]

5. **Apply the initial condition:**
   We are given the initial condition \( z(0) = 0 \). Substituting \( t = 0 \) into the general solution \( z(t) = 3 + Ce^{-2t} \) gives:
   \[
   z(0) = 3 + Ce^{-2 \cdot 0} = 3 + C = 0
   \]
   Solving for \( C \) gives:
   \[
   C = -3
   \]

6. **Write the particular solution:**
   Substituting \( C = -3 \) back into the general solution \( z(t) = 3 + Ce^{-2t} \) gives the particular solution:
   \[
   z(t) = 3 - 3e^{-2t}
   \]

Therefore, the solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation \( z' + 2z = 6 \) with the initial condition \( z(0) = 0 \) is:
\[
\boxed{3 - 3e^{-2t}}

7,Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct,7,22,Let X be the number of heads obtained when 3 fair coins are flipped. What is P(X \ge 1)?,"To find the probability \( P(X \ge 1) \) where \( X \) is the number of heads obtained when 3 fair coins are flipped, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   Each coin has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails). Since there are 3 coins, the total number of possible outcomes is:
   \[
   2^3 = 8
   \]
   The possible outcomes are: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT.

2. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes for \( X \ge 1 \):**
   Instead of counting the number of outcomes where we get at least 1 head directly, it is easier to count the number of outcomes where we get 0 heads (i.e., all tails) and subtract this from the total number of outcomes.
   - The outcome where we get 0 heads is TTT.
   - There is only 1 outcome where we get 0 heads.
   - Therefore, the number of outcomes where we get at least 1 head is:
     \[
     8 - 1 = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the probability \( P(X \ge 1) \):**
   The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, we have:
   \[
   P(X \ge 1) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{7}{8}
   \]

Thus, the probability that we get at least 1 head when 3 fair coins are flipped is \(\boxed{\frac{7}{8}}\).","Let X be Binomial(3, 0.5), the number of heads in 3 fair coin flips. Using linearity of expectation instead of enumerating all outcomes, compute E[2X - 1].","To find the expected value \( E[2X - 1] \) where \( X \) is a Binomial(3, 0.5) random variable, we can use the linearity of expectation. The linearity of expectation states that for any random variables \( Y \) and \( Z \) and any constants \( a \) and \( b \), \( E[aY + bZ] = aE[Y] + bE[Z] \). In this case, we can apply it to \( E[2X - 1] \) as follows:

\[
E[2X - 1] = E[2X] - E[1]
\]

Since \( E[1] = 1 \), we have:

\[
E[2X - 1] = E[2X] - 1
\]

Next, we use the property of expectation that \( E[aX] = aE[X] \). Therefore, we have:

\[
E[2X] = 2E[X]
\]

So, substituting this back into our equation, we get:

\[
E[2X - 1] = 2E[X] - 1
\]

Now, we need to find \( E[X] \). Since \( X \) is a Binomial(3, 0.5) random variable, the expected value of a Binomial random variable \( \text{Binomial}(n, p) \) is given by \( E[X] = np \). Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( p = 0.5 \), so:

\[
E[X] = 3 \cdot 0.5 = 1.5
\]

Substituting \( E[X] = 1.5 \) into our equation for \( E[2X - 1] \), we get:

\[
E[2X - 1] = 2 \cdot 1.5 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2

8,Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct,8,23,"Compute the definite integral \int_0^{\pi} \sin x \, dx.","To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^{\pi} \sin x \, dx\), we follow these steps:

1. Identify the antiderivative of the integrand \(\sin x\). The antiderivative of \(\sin x\) is \(-\cos x\). This means that:
   \[
   \int \sin x \, dx = -\cos x + C
   \]
   where \(C\) is the constant of integration. For a definite integral, we do not need the constant \(C\).

2. Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that the definite integral of a function \(f(x)\) from \(a\) to \(b\) is given by:
   \[
   \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
   \]
   where \(F(x)\) is the antiderivative of \(f(x)\). In our case, \(f(x) = \sin x\) and \(F(x) = -\cos x\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \int_0^{\pi} \sin x \, dx = -\cos(\pi) - (-\cos(0))

1. **Distribute the integral over the sum:**
   \[
   \int_0^{\pi} (3 + 2 \sin x) \, dx = \int_0^{\pi} 3 \, dx + \int_0^{\pi} 2 \sin x \, dx

   \]
   \[
   \int_0^{\pi} 2 \sin x \, dx = 2 \int_0^{\pi} \sin x \, dx

3. **Evaluate the integrals:**
   - The integral of 1 over the interval \([0, \pi]\) is the length of the interval:
     \[
     \int_0^{\pi} 1 \, dx = \pi

1. **Calculate the mean (average) of the data set.**
   The mean \(\mu\) is given by the formula:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
   \]
   where \(x_i\) are the values in the data set and \(n\) is the number of values. For our data set [1, 2, 3, 4], we have:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4}{4} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5
   \]

2. **Calculate the squared differences from the mean for each value in the data set.**
   For each value \(x_i\), we compute \((x_i - \mu)^2\):
   \[
   (1 - 2.5)^2 = (-1.5)^2 = 2.25
   \]
   \[
   (2 - 2.5)^2 = (-0.5)^2 = 0.25

   \[
   (3 - 2.5)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25

   \[
   (4 - 2.5)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25

where \(N\) is the number of data points, \(x_i\) are the data points, and \(\mu\) is the population mean.

Given the original data set \([1, 2, 3, 4]\) with a population variance of 1.25, we know:

\[
\sigma^2 = 1.25

The new data set is formed by adding 5 to every value in the original data set, resulting in \([6, 7, 8, 9]\). Let's denote the original data set by \(x_i\) and the new data set by \(y_i\). Therefore, we have:

\[
y_i = x_i + 5
\]

The mean of the new data set \(\mu_y\) can be expressed in terms of the mean of the original data set \(\mu_x\):

\[
\mu_y = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i + 5) = \frac{1}{N} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i + 5N \right) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i + \frac{5N}{N} = \mu_x + 5

\[
\sigma_y^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \mu_y)^2

Substituting \(y_i = x_i + 5\) and \(\mu_y = \mu_x + 5\) into the formula, we get:

Compute E[X].,"To compute the expected value \( E[X] \) of a fair six-sided die, we start by noting that the die has six faces, each showing a different number from 1 to 6. Since the die is fair, each face has an equal probability of landing face up. Therefore, the probability \( P(X = k) \) for each \( k \) from 1 to 6 is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

The expected value \( E[X] \) is given by the formula:
\[
E[X] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot P(X = k)
\]
Substituting the probability \( P(X = k) = \frac{1}{6} \) into the formula, we get:
\[
E[X] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{k=1}^{6} k
\]
Next, we need to find the sum of the first 6 positive integers. The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]
For \( n = 6 \), the sum is:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{6} k = \frac{6(6+1)}{2} = \frac{6 \cdot 7}{2} = 21
\]
Substituting this sum back into the expected value formula, we get:
\[
E[X] = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 21 = \frac{21}{6} = 3.5
\]
Therefore, the expected value of the outcome when a fair six-sided die is rolled once is:
\[
\boxed{3.5}
\]","Let X be the outcome of a fair six-sided die, so E[X] = 3.5. Define Y = 7 - X. Without recomputing from the distribution, use linearity of expectation or symmetry to compute E[Y].","To find the expected value \( E[Y] \) where \( Y = 7 - X \) and \( X \) is the outcome of a fair six-sided die, we can use the linearity of expectation. The linearity of expectation states that for any two random variables \( X \) and \( Y \), and any constants \( a \) and \( b \), the expected value of \( aX + bY \) is \( aE[X] + bE[Y] \). In this case, we have \( Y = 7 - X \), so we can write:

\[
E[Y] = E[7 - X]
\]

Using the linearity of expectation, we can split this into two parts:

\[
E[7 - X] = E[7] - E[X]
\]

Since \( E[7] = 7 \) (the expected value of a constant is the constant itself), we have:

\[
E[7 - X] = 7 - E[X]
\]

We are given that \( E[X] = 3.5 \), so we substitute this value in:

\[
E[7 - X] = 7 - 3.5 = 3.5
\]

Therefore, the expected value of \( Y \) is:

\[
\boxed{3.5}

13,Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct,13,28,"Compute the definite integral \int_0^1 (2x + 1) \, dx.","To compute the definite integral \(\int_0^1 (2x + 1) \, dx\), we will follow these steps:

1. Find the antiderivative of the integrand \(2x + 1\).
2. Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit of integration (1) and the lower limit of integration (0).
3. Subtract the value of the antiderivative at the lower limit from the value at the upper limit.

Let's start with the first step. The antiderivative of \(2x + 1\) is found by integrating each term separately. The antiderivative of \(2x\) is \(x^2\) and the antiderivative of \(1\) is \(x\). Therefore, the antiderivative of \(2x + 1\) is:
\[
x^2 + x + C
\]
where \(C\) is the constant of integration. Since we are dealing with a definite integral, we can ignore the constant \(C\). So, the antiderivative we need is:
\[
x^2 + x
\]

Next, we evaluate this antiderivative at the upper limit of integration (1) and the lower limit of integration (0):
\[
\left. (x^2 + x) \right|_0^1 = (1^2 + 1) - (0^2 + 0) = 1 + 1 - 0 - 0 = 2
\]

Therefore, the value of the definite integral \(\int_0^1 (2x + 1) \, dx\) is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]","Let F(x) = \int_0^x (2t + 1) \, dt. Using properties of antiderivatives and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, compute F(1) without performing a full integral from scratch if possible.","To find \( F(1) \) for the function \( F(x) = \int_0^x (2t + 1) \, dt \), we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that if \( F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt \), then \( F'(x) = f(x) \). Here, \( f(t) = 2t + 1 \), so \( F'(x) = 2x + 1 \).

To find \( F(x) \), we need to find the antiderivative of \( 2x + 1 \). The antiderivative of \( 2x \) is \( x^2 \) and the antiderivative of \( 1 \) is \( x \). Therefore, the antiderivative of \( 2x + 1 \) is \( x^2 + x + C \), where \( C \) is a constant. Since \( F(x) = \int_0^x (2t + 1) \, dt \), we know that \( F(0) = 0 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the antiderivative, we get:
\[ F(0) = 0^2 + 0 + C = C = 0. \]
So, the antiderivative is \( x^2 + x \). Therefore, we have:
\[ F(x) = x^2 + x. \]
To find \( F(1) \), we substitute \( x = 1 \) into the antiderivative:
\[ F(1) = 1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. \]
Thus, the value of \( F(1) \) is \(\boxed{2}\).",2,3,3,"{""correctness"": ""The final answer F(1) = 2 is fully correct, matching the expected result from the definite integral."", ""reasoning_quality"": ""The reasoning is clear and well-structured.

1. **Order the data set**: The data set is already in ascending order, so we can proceed directly to the next step.
2. **Determine the number of data points**: The data set has 7 values.
3. **Identify the position of the median**: Since the number of data points is odd, the median is the value in the middle position. For a data set with \( n \) values, the median is the \( \left( \frac{n+1}{2} \right) \)-th value. Here, \( n = 7 \), so the median is the \( \left( \frac{7+1}{2} \right) = 4 \)-th value.
4. **Find the value in the 4th position**: The 4th value in the ordered data set [1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9] is 6.

Therefore, the median of the data set is \(\boxed{6}\).","A data set consists of the values [1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9] with median 6. A new data set is formed by duplicating each value, so each of the seven numbers now appears twice. Without listing all 14 values explicitly, determine the median of the new data set.","To determine the median of the new data set, we start by understanding the original data set and how duplicating each value affects its median.

The original data set is [1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The median of a data set is the middle value when the data set is ordered from smallest to largest. Since there are 7 values in the original data set, the median is the 4th value, which is 6.

When each value in the original data set is duplicated, the new data set becomes [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]. The new data set has 14 values. The median of a data set with an even number of values is the average of the two middle values when the data set is ordered from smallest to largest. In this case, the two middle values are the 7th and 8th values in the ordered list.

Looking at the ordered list [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9], we see that the 7th value is 6 and the 8th value is 7. Therefore, the median of the new data set is the average of 6 and 7, which is:

\[
\frac{6 + 7}{2} = \frac{13}{2} = 6.5

Thus, the median of the new data set is \(\boxed{6.5}\).",2,3,3,"{""correctness"": ""The variant response correctly determines that the new data set has 14 values, identifies the 7th and 8th positions as the middle values, and correctly calculates the median as 6.5.
