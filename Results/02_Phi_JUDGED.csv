For the given matrix A = [[2, 1], [1, 2]], the identity matrix I is [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. Now, we need to find the determinant of (A - λI):

A - λI = [[2 - λ, 1], [1, 2 - λ]]

Now, let's find the determinant:

det(A - λI) = (2 - λ)(2 - λ) - (1)(1)

Expanding and simplifying the expression:

= λ^2 - 4λ + 4 - 1
= λ^2 - 4λ + 3

Now, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation:

λ^2 - 4λ + 3 = 0

We can factor this equation:

(λ - 3)(λ - 1) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero, we get the eigenvalues:

λ - 3 = 0 => λ = 3
λ - 1 = 0 => λ = 1

Let λ be an eigenvalue of A with the corresponding eigenvector x. Then, we have:

A * x = λ * x

Now, let's consider the matrix B = A^2 + 3I. We want to find the eigenvalues of B, so we need to find the eigenvalues of A^2 and 3I separately and then add them together.

First, let's find the eigenvalues of A^2. Since A has eigenvalues 1 and 3, we can find the eigenvalues of A^2 by squaring these eigenvalues:

(1)^2 = 1
(3)^2 = 9

So, the eigenvalues of A^2 are 1 and 9.

Now, let's find the eigenvalues of 3I. Since I is the identity matrix, its eigenvalues are all 1. Multiplying the identity matrix by 3, we get:

3I * x = 3 * x

So, the eigenvalues of 3I are all 3.

Now, we can find the eigenvalues of B by adding the eigenvalues of A^2 and 3I:

r^2 + 4r + 4 = 0

Now, we need to factor this quadratic equation:

(r + 2)(r + 2) = 0

This gives us a repeated root:

r = -2

y(t) = C1 * e^(-2t) + C2 * t * e^(-2t)

Now, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can factor it as:

(r + 2)(r + 2) = 0

The roots are r = -2 (with multiplicity 2).

Since we have a repeated root, the damping behavior is critically damped.

(b) For a critically damped system, the general solution of the differential equation is given by:

y(t) = (A + Bt)e^(-2t)

We are given the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = 0. Let's use these to find the constants A and B.

Using y(0) = 1:

1 = (A + B(0))e^(-2(0))
1 = A

Now, let's find the derivative of y(t):

y'(t) = B*e^(-2t) - 2(A + Bt)e^(-2t)

Using y'(0) = 0:

0 = B*e^(-2(0)) - 2(A + B(0))e^(-2(0))
0 = B - 2A

Since we already found that A = 1, we can solve for B:

2,Microsoft-Phi-3.5,2,17,Three fair coins are flipped. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 heads?,"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations and the basic probability formula:

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)

Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes

When flipping three fair coins, each coin has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). Since there are three coins, the total number of possible outcomes is 2^3 = 8. These outcomes can be listed as follows:

1. HHH
2. HHT
3. HTH
4. HTT
5. THH
6. THT
7. TTH
8. TTT

Step 2: Determine the number of favorable outcomes

We are interested in the outcomes with exactly 2 heads. There are three such outcomes:

1. HHT
2. HTH
3. THH

So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

Step 3: Calculate the probability

Now, we can use the probability formula:

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)
Probability = 3 / 8

The probability of getting exactly 2 heads when flipping three fair coins is 3/8 or 0.375.","Three biased coins are flipped, each showing heads with probability 0.6 and tails with probability 0.4, independently. What is the probability of obtaining at least 2 heads?","To find the probability of obtaining at least 2 heads, we can find the probability of obtaining exactly 2 heads and the probability of obtaining exactly 3 heads, and then add them together.

The probability of obtaining exactly 2 heads can be found using the binomial probability formula:

P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

where n is the number of trials (in this case, 3 coin flips), k is the number of successful outcomes (in this case, 2 heads), p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.6 for heads), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.

For exactly 2 heads:

P(X = 2) = C(3, 2) * 0.6^2 * 0.4^1
P(X = 2) = 3 * 0.36 * 0.4
P(X = 2) = 0.432

The probability of obtaining exactly 3 heads is:

P(X = 3) = C(3, 3) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^0
P(X = 3) = 1 * 0.216 * 1
P(X = 3) = 0.216

Now, we add the probabilities of obtaining exactly 2 heads and exactly 3 heads:

P(at least 2 heads) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)
P(at least 2 heads) = 0.432 + 0.216

Let μ be an eigenvalue of C. Then, for some non-zero vector v, we have:

Cv = μv

Since C = A^{-1} + I, we can write:

(dy/y) = -2 dt

Next, integrate both sides:

Step 1: Calculate the probability of getting no heads (all tails) when flipping 3 coins.

Since the coins are fair, the probability of getting a tail on a single flip is 1/2. The probability of getting tails on all three flips is the product of the probabilities of getting a tail on each individual flip:

P(all tails) = P(tail on flip 1) * P(tail on flip 2) * P(tail on flip 3)

\(\int_0^{\pi} (3 + 2 \sin x) \, dx = \int_0^{\pi} 3 \, dx + \int_0^{\pi} 2 \sin x \, dx\)

Step 2: Compute the first integral.

The integral of a constant is just the constant times the length of the interval. In this case, the constant is 3 and the interval is from 0 to \(\pi\).

\(\int_0^{\pi} 3 \, dx = 3 \int_0^{\pi} 1 \, dx = 3[\pi - 0] = 3\pi\)

Step 3: Compute the second integral using the given fact.

We are given that \(\int_0^{\pi} \sin x \, dx = 2\). So,

\(\int_0^{\pi} 2 \sin x \, dx = 2 \int_0^{\pi} \sin x \, dx = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\)

Step 4: Combine the results.

3. Calculate the average of these squared deviations.

Let's go through these steps with the given data set [1, 2, 3, 4]:

Step 1: Calculate the mean
Mean = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5

Step 2: Calculate the squared deviations
(1 - 2.5)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25
(2 - 2.5)^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25
(3 - 2.5)^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25
(4 - 2.5)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25

Step 3: Calculate the average of the squared deviations
Population variance = (2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25

It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences from the mean.

Given that the original data set has a variance of 1.25, we can use the properties of variance to find the variance of the new data set without recomputing all deviations.

When you add a constant to every value in the data set, the mean of the data set will increase by that constant, but the spread of the data (variance) will not change. This is because variance is a measure of the spread of the data around the mean, and adding a constant shifts all data points equally, so their relative positions to each other and to the new mean remain the same.

In this case, we are adding 5 to each value in the original data set [1, 2, 3, 4]. The new data set will be [6, 7, 8, 9]. The mean of the original data set is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5. After adding 5 to each value, the new mean will be 2.5 + 5 = 7.5.

Since the variance does not change when adding a constant to each data point, the population variance of the new data set will be the same as the original, which is 1.25.

Find all eigenvalues of R.","To find the eigenvalues of the matrix R, we need to solve the characteristic equation, which is given by the determinant of (R - λI), where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

The matrix R is:

R = [[0, -1],
     [1,  0]]

The identity matrix I for a 2x2 matrix is:

I = [[1, 0],
     [0, 1]]

Now, we need to find the matrix (R - λI):

R - λI = [[0 - λ, -1],
          [1,      0 - λ]]

This simplifies to:

[[-λ, -1],
 [1, -λ]]

Now, we need to find the determinant of this matrix:

det(-λ, -1, 1, -λ) = (-λ)(-λ) - (-1)(1) = λ^2 + 1

Now, we need to solve the characteristic equation:

λ^2 + 1 = 0

To solve for λ, we can factor the equation as a difference of squares:

(λ - i)(λ + i) = 0

This gives us two eigenvalues:

λ1 = i
λ2 = -i

So, the eigenvalues of the matrix R are i and -i.","The matrix R = [[0, -1], [1, 0]] represents a 90° counterclockwise rotation in the plane and has eigenvalues i and -i. Consider S = R^4. Without multiplying matrices explicitly, determine all eigenvalues of S.","To find the eigenvalues of S without explicitly multiplying matrices, we can use the properties of eigenvalues and matrix powers.

Given that R is a 90° counterclockwise rotation matrix, its eigenvalues are i and -i. This is because a 90° counterclockwise rotation in the plane is a unitary matrix (since it preserves the length of vectors and its transpose is its inverse), and the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix have absolute value 1.

Now, let's consider the matrix S = R^4. Since R is a rotation matrix, we know that R^2 is a 180° rotation (because 90° * 2 = 180°), which is equivalent to a reflection across the origin in the plane. A reflection matrix has eigenvalues that are either +1 or -1, because it either preserves or inverts the length of vectors.

When we raise R to the fourth power, we are effectively applying the 90° rotation four times, which corresponds to a full 360° rotation. A full 360° rotation brings a vector back to its original position, which means the transformation is the identity transformation. The identity matrix has eigenvalues of +1, as it leaves all vectors unchanged.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of S = R^4 are all +1. There are no other eigenvalues because the only possible eigenvalues for a matrix that represents a full rotation (360°) are +1 and -1, and since we've established that S is the identity matrix, the eigenvalues are all +1.

In summary, the eigenvalues of S are:

\[\lambda_3 = 1\]

Step 1: Integrate the differential equation y' = 3x^2

∫(3x^2) dx = x^3 + C

where C is the constant of integration.

Step 2: Apply the initial condition y(0) = 1

Now we need to find the value of C by plugging in the initial condition into the integrated equation:

y(0) = (0)^3 + C = 1

0 + C = 1

C = 1

Step 3: Write the final solution for y(x)

Now that we have the value of C, we can write the final solution for y(x):

Now, we can rewrite the differential equation in terms of u:

dy/dx = 3u^2

Since y' = dy/dx, we have:

dy/du = 3u^2

Now, we can integrate both sides with respect to u:

∫(dy/du) du = ∫3u^2 du

y(u) = u^3 + C

Now, we need to find the constant C using the initial condition y(2) = 5. When u = 0 (since u = x - 2 and x = 2), we have:

y(0) = 0^3 + C = C

Since y(0) = 5, we have:

C = 5

So, the solution in terms of u is:

y(u) = u^3 + 5

Compute E[X].,"To compute the expected value (E[X]) of a random variable X, we need to sum the products of each outcome and its probability. For a fair six-sided die, each side has an equal probability of landing face up.

Let's denote the outcomes as S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The probability of each outcome is 1/6 since the die is fair.

Now, we can compute the expected value:

E[X] = Σ (x * P(X = x))

Given that Y = 7 - X, we can express the expected value of Y as:

E[Y] = E[7 - X]

Using the linearity of expectation, which states that E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b for any constants a and b, we can rewrite the above expression as:

E[Y] = 7E[1] - E[X]

Since E[1] is simply the expected value of a constant, which is the constant itself, we have E[1] = 1. Now we can plug in the known values:

E[Y] = 7 * 1 - 3.5
E[Y] = 7 - 3.5
E[Y] = 3.5

So, the expected value of Y is also 3.5. This result makes sense because Y is a linear transformation of X, and the expected value of a linear transformation of a random variable is the transformation of the expected value of the original variable.
