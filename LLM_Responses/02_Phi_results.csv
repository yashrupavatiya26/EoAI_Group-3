Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)

Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes

When flipping three fair coins, each coin has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). Since there are three coins, the total number of possible outcomes is 2^3 = 8. These outcomes can be listed as follows:

1. HHH
2. HHT

8. TTT

Step 2: Determine the number of favorable outcomes

We are interested in the outcomes with exactly 2 heads. There are three such outcomes:

6,Microsoft-Phi-3.5,Solve the differential equation y' + 2y = 0 for y(t). Give the general solution.,"To solve the differential equation y' + 2y = 0, we can use the method of separation of variables. 

First, rewrite the equation as:

y' = -2y

Now, separate the variables by dividing both sides by y and multiplying both sides by dt:

(dy/y) = -2 dt

Next, integrate both sides:

∫(dy/y) = ∫(-2 dt)

The integral of (dy/y) is ln|y|, and the integral of -2 dt is -2t. So, we have:

ln|y| = -2t + C₁

To solve for y, we can exponentiate both sides:

e^(ln|y|) = e^(-2t + C₁)

Since e^(ln|y|) = |y| and e^(C₁) = C₂ (where C₂ is a constant), we have:

|y| = C₂ * e^(-2t)

We can approach this by first finding the probability of the complementary event (getting no heads) and then subtracting that from 1.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of getting no heads (all tails) when flipping 3 coins.

Since the coins are fair, the probability of getting a tail on a single flip is 1/2. The probability of getting tails on all three flips is the product of the probabilities of getting a tail on each individual flip:

P(all tails) = P(tail on flip 1) * P(tail on flip 2) * P(tail on flip 3)
P(all tails) = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2)
P(all tails) = 1/8

Step 2: Calculate the probability of getting at least one head.

P(at least one head) = 1 - P(all tails)
P(at least one head) = 1 - 1/8

\(\int_0^{\pi} 3 \, dx = 3 \int_0^{\pi} 1 \, dx = 3[\pi - 0] = 3\pi\)

Step 3: Compute the second integral using the given fact.

We are given that \(\int_0^{\pi} \sin x \, dx = 2\). So,

\(\int_0^{\pi} 2 \sin x \, dx = 2 \int_0^{\pi} \sin x \, dx = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\)

Step 4: Combine the results.

Now, we add the results of the two integrals:

\(3\pi + 4\)

So, \(\int_0^{\pi} (3 + 2 \sin x) \, dx = 3\pi + 4\).",25.593,366,14.3
24,Microsoft-Phi-3.5,"A data set consists of the values [1, 2, 3, 4] with population variance 1.25. A new data set is formed by adding 5 to every value, giving [6, 7, 8, 9]. Without recomputing all deviations, determine the population variance of the new data set.","The population variance is a measure of how spread out the values in a data set are. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences from the mean.

Given that the original data set has a variance of 1.25, we can use the properties of variance to find the variance of the new data set without recomputing all deviations.

When you add a constant to every value in the data set, the mean of the data set will increase by that constant, but the spread of the data (variance) will not change. This is because variance is a measure of the spread of the data around the mean, and adding a constant shifts all data points equally, so their relative positions to each other and to the new mean remain the same.

In this case, we are adding 5 to each value in the original data set [1, 2, 3, 4]. The new data set will be [6, 7, 8, 9]. The mean of the original data set is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5. After adding 5 to each value, the new mean will be 2.5 + 5 = 7.5.

Since the variance does not change when adding a constant to each data point, the population variance of the new data set will be the same as the original, which is 1.25.

Therefore, the population variance of the new data set [6, 7, 8, 9] is also 1.25.",23.777,335,14.09
25,Microsoft-Phi-3.5,"The matrix R = [[0, -1], [1, 0]] represents a 90° counterclockwise rotation in the plane and has eigenvalues i and -i. Consider S = R^4. Without multiplying matrices explicitly, determine all eigenvalues of S.","To find the eigenvalues of S without explicitly multiplying matrices, we can use the properties of eigenvalues and matrix powers.

Given that R is a 90° counterclockwise rotation matrix, its eigenvalues are i and -i. This is because a 90° counterclockwise rotation in the plane is a unitary matrix (since it preserves the length of vectors and its transpose is its inverse), and the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix have absolute value 1.

Now, let's consider the matrix S = R^4. Since R is a rotation matrix, we know that R^2 is a 180° rotation (because 90° * 2 = 180°), which is equivalent to a reflection across the origin in the plane. A reflection matrix has eigenvalues that are either +1 or -1, because it either preserves or inverts the length of vectors.

When we raise R to the fourth power, we are effectively applying the 90° rotation four times, which corresponds to a full 360° rotation. A full 360° rotation brings a vector back to its original position, which means the transformation is the identity transformation. The identity matrix has eigenvalues of +1, as it leaves all vectors unchanged.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of S = R^4 are all +1. There are no other eigenvalues because the only possible eigenvalues for a matrix that represents a full rotation (360°) are +1 and -1, and since we've established that S is the identity matrix, the eigenvalues are all +1.

In summary, the eigenvalues of S are:

\[\lambda_1 = 1\]
\[\lambda_2 = 1\]
\[\lambda_3 = 1\]
\[\lambda_4 = 1\]

All eigenvalues are +1.",27.964,402,14.38
26,Microsoft-Phi-3.5,The function y(x) = x^3 + 1 solves the initial value problem y' = 3x^2 with y(0) = 1. Now consider the differential equation y' = 3(x - 2)^2 with initial condition y(2) = 5. Use a substitution or analogy with the previous solution to find y(x).,"To solve the differential equation y' = 3(x - 2)^2 with the initial condition y(2) = 5, we can use a substitution method. Let's define a new variable u such that u = x - 2. Then, we have:

du/dx = 1

Now, we can rewrite the differential equation in terms of u:

dy/dx = 3u^2

Since y' = dy/dx, we have:

dy/du = 3u^2

Now, we can integrate both sides with respect to u:

∫(dy/du) du = ∫3u^2 du

y(u) = u^3 + C

Now, we need to find the constant C using the initial condition y(2) = 5. When u = 0 (since u = x - 2 and x = 2), we have:

y(0) = 0^3 + C = C

Since y(0) = 5, we have:

C = 5

So, the solution in terms of u is:

y(u) = u^3 + 5

Now, we can substitute back u = x - 2:

y(x) = (x - 2)^3 + 5

This is the solution to the differential equation y' = 3(x - 2)^2 with the initial condition y(2) = 5.",23.168,330,14.24
27,Microsoft-Phi-3.5,"Let X be the outcome of a fair six-sided die, so E[X] = 3.5. Define Y = 7 - X. Without recomputing from the distribution, use linearity of expectation or symmetry to compute E[Y].","To compute E[Y] without recomputing from the distribution, we can use the linearity of expectation and the fact that Y is a transformation of X.

Given that Y = 7 - X, we can express the expected value of Y as:

E[Y] = E[7 - X]

Using the linearity of expectation, which states that E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b for any constants a and b, we can rewrite the above expression as:

E[Y] = 7E[1] - E[X]

Since E[1] is simply the expected value of a constant, which is the constant itself, we have E[1] = 1. Now we can plug in the known values:

E[Y] = 7 * 1 - 3.5
E[Y] = 7 - 3.5
E[Y] = 3.5

So, the expected value of Y is also 3.5. This result makes sense because Y is a linear transformation of X, and the expected value of a linear transformation of a random variable is the transformation of the expected value of the original variable. In this case, since the transformation is a reflection across the vertical line x = 3.5 (because 7 - X is the same as saying ""7 minus the outcome of the die""), the expected value remains the same.",21.797,309,14.18

Using properties of antiderivatives and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, compute F(1) without performing a full integral from scratch if possible.","To compute F(1), we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if F(x) is an antiderivative of f(t), then:

F(x) = F(b) - F(a) = ∫[a, b] f(t) dt

In this case, f(t) = 2t + 1. We need to find an antiderivative F(t) of f(t) and then evaluate F(1) - F(0).

An antiderivative of f(t) = 2t + 1 is F(t) = t^2 + t + C, where C is the constant of integration. We can ignore C since we are interested in the difference F(1) - F(0).

Now, we can evaluate F(1) and F(0):

F(1) = (1)^2 + (1) = 1 + 1 = 2
F(0) = (0)^2 + (0) = 0

So, F(1) - F(0) = 2 - 0 = 2

Therefore, F(1) = 2.",19.486,268,13.75

When each value in the data set is duplicated, the order of the data set does not change because the duplicates are identical to the original values. Therefore, the fourth value in the new data set will still be the median.

So, the median of the new data set is 6.",11.568,162,14.0
