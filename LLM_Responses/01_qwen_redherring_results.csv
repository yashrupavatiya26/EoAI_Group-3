1,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"Ninety-six golf balls were picked up at the driving range and placed into two buckets. Although many people quickly guess the buckets contain 48 each, one actually has twenty-eight more golf balls than the other. How many golf balls are in each bucket?","To determine the number of golf balls in each bucket, let's define the number of golf balls in the first bucket as \( x \). According to the problem, the second bucket has twenty-eight more golf balls than the first bucket, so the number of golf balls in the second bucket is \( x + 28 \).

The total number of golf balls picked up is 96, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of golf balls in both buckets:
\[ x + (x + 28) = 96 \]

Next, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2x + 28 = 96 \]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 28 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 68 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 34 \]

So, the number of golf balls in the first bucket is 34. Since the second bucket has twenty-eight more golf balls than the first bucket, we add 28 to 34 to find the number of golf balls in the second bucket:
\[ x + 28 = 34 + 28 = 62 \]

Therefore, the number of golf balls in each bucket is \(\boxed{34 \text{ and } 62}\).",19.386,288,14.86
2,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"Jay’s father is twice as old as Jay. In 20 years, Jay will be two-thirds as old as his father. Note that many students mistakenly set up the equation using current ages incorrectly and get 30 and 60. How old is each now?","Let's denote Jay's current age as \( J \) and his father's current age as \( F \). According to the problem, Jay's father is twice as old as Jay, so we can write the first equation as:
\[ F = 2J \]

In 20 years, Jay's age will be \( J + 20 \) and his father's age will be \( F + 20 \). The problem also states that in 20 years, Jay will be two-thirds as old as his father, so we can write the second equation as:
\[ J + 20 = \frac{2}{3}(F + 20) \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( F \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ J + 20 = \frac{2}{3}(2J + 20) \]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ 3(J + 20) = 2(2J + 20) \]
\[ 3J + 60 = 4J + 40 \]

Now, we isolate \( J \) by subtracting \( 3J \) and 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 60 - 40 = 4J - 3J \]
\[ 20 = J \]

So, Jay's current age is 20 years. To find his father's current age, we substitute \( J = 20 \) back into the first equation:
\[ F = 2J = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, Jay is currently 20 years old and his father is currently 40 years old. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20 \text{ and } 40} \]",25.884,395,15.26
3,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"Tickets for a baseball game were $2.50 for general admission and $0.50 for kids. There were six times as many general admission tickets sold as kids’ tickets, and total receipts were $7750. Although some people think 2000 kids’ tickets were sold because 6×2000=12000 total tickets sounds round, how many of each type were actually sold?","Let's define the number of kids' tickets sold as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of general admission tickets sold is six times the number of kids' tickets, so we can express the number of general admission tickets as \( 6x \).

The price of each kids' ticket is $0.50, and the price of each general admission ticket is $2.50. The total receipts from the tickets sold is $7750. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total receipts:

\[ 0.50x + 2.50(6x) = 7750 \]

First, simplify the equation by combining like terms:

\[ 0.50x + 15x = 7750 \]
\[ 15.50x = 7750 \]

Next, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 15.50:

\[ x = \frac{7750}{15.50} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, the number of kids' tickets sold is 500. Since the number of general admission tickets sold is six times the number of kids' tickets, we can find the number of general admission tickets by multiplying 500 by 6:

\[ 6x = 6 \times 500 = 3000 \]

Therefore, the number of kids' tickets sold is 500, and the number of general admission tickets sold is 3000. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{500 \text{ kids' tickets}, 3000 \text{ general admission tickets}}

4,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,The Hailu family is traveling with the Garcias. One day they get separated and the Garcias are 20 miles ahead on the same road. The Garcias average 50 mph while the Hailus travel at 60 mph. Many people forget relative speed and think it takes 2 hours because 20 miles / 10 mph difference = 2. How long will it actually be before the Hailus catch up?,"To determine how long it will take for the Hailus to catch up to the Garcias, we need to consider their relative speed. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds, which is the speed at which the distance between them is decreasing.

The speed of the Hailus is 60 mph, and the speed of the Garcias is 50 mph. Therefore, the relative speed is:
\[ 60 \text{ mph} - 50 \text{ mph} = 10 \text{ mph} \]

This means that the Hailus are closing the gap between them at a rate of 10 miles per hour. The initial gap between them is 20 miles. To find out how long it will take for the Hailus to close this gap, we divide the initial gap by the relative speed:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will actually take \(\boxed{2}\) hours for the Hailus to catch up to the Garcias.",16.227,232,14.3
5,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"Joanna has a full deck of three-digit numbers (100 to 999). She picks one at random. Although many believe the sum of digits 15 occurs exactly 100 times because of symmetry around 15, determine the actual probability that the sum of the digits is 15.","To determine the probability that the sum of the digits of a randomly chosen three-digit number is 15, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the total number of three-digit numbers:**
   A three-digit number ranges from 100 to 999. Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers is:
   \[
   999 - 100 + 1 = 900
   \]

2. **Count the number of three-digit numbers whose digits sum to 15:**
   Let the three-digit number be represented as \(abc\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are its digits. We need to find the number of solutions to the equation:
   \[
   a + b + c = 15
   \]
   subject to the constraints:
   \[
   1 \leq a \leq 9 \quad \text{and} \quad 0 \leq b, c \leq 9
   \]

   To simplify, we can use a change of variables. Let \(a' = a - 1\). Then \(a'\) ranges from 0 to 8, and the equation becomes:
   \[
   a' + b + c = 14
   \]
   Now, we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation. This is a classic ""stars and bars"" problem, and the number of solutions is given by:
   \[
   \binom{14 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{16}{2}
   \]

   Calculate \(\binom{16}{2}\):
   \[
   \binom{16}{2} = \frac{16 \times 15}{2 \times 1} = 120
   \]

   However, we must ensure that \(a' \leq 8\), which means \(a \leq 9\). We need to subtract the cases where \(a' > 8\). If \(a' > 8\), then \(a' \geq 9\). Let \(a'' = a' - 9\). Then \(a'' \geq 0\), and the equation becomes:
   \[
   a'' + b + c = 5
   \]

   The number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation is:
   \[
   \binom{5 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{7}{2}
   \]

   Calculate \(\binom{7}{2}\):
   \[
   \binom{7}{2} = \frac{7 \times 6}{2 \times 1} = 21
   \]

   Therefore, the number of valid solutions where \(a \leq 9\) is:
   \[
   120 - 21 = 99
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that a randomly chosen three-digit number has a digit sum of 15 is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:
   \[
   \frac{99}{900} = \frac{11}{100}
   \]

Thus, the actual probability that the sum of the digits is 15 is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{11}{100}}

6,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"A bowl contains raspberries and blueberries. Natasha added 10 more raspberries, making 3/10 of the berries raspberries. Then Jing added 20 blueberries, after which only 1/4 were raspberries. Many people work backwards from the final 1/4 and get 3/7 originally. What fraction of the original berries were actually raspberries?","Let's denote the original number of raspberries as \( r \) and the original number of blueberries as \( b \). The total number of berries originally is \( r + b \).

First, Natasha added 10 more raspberries, so the new number of raspberries is \( r + 10 \) and the new total number of berries is \( r + b + 10 \). According to the problem, after Natasha added the raspberries, the proportion of raspberries is \( \frac{3}{10} \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{r + 10}{r + b + 10} = \frac{3}{10}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
10(r + 10) = 3(r + b + 10)
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
10r + 100 = 3r + 3b + 30
\]
Rearranging terms to isolate \( r \) and \( b \), we have:
\[
7r - 3b = -70 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Next, Jing added 20 blueberries, so the new number of blueberries is \( b + 20 \) and the new total number of berries is \( r + b + 30 \). According to the problem, after Jing added the blueberries, the proportion of raspberries is \( \frac{1}{4} \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{r + 10}{r + b + 30} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
4(r + 10) = r + b + 30
\]
Expanding both sides, we get:
\[
4r + 40 = r + b + 30
\]
Rearranging terms to isolate \( r \) and \( b \), we have:
\[
3r - b = -10 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
7r - 3b = -70 \\
3r - b = -10
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( b \), we can multiply Equation 2 by 3:
\[
9r - 3b = -30
\]

Now we subtract Equation 1 from this new equation:
\[
(9r - 3b) - (7r - 3b) = -30 - (-70)
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
2r = 40
\]
Solving for \( r \), we find:
\[
r = 20
\]

Next, we substitute \( r = 20 \) back into Equation 2:
\[
3(20) - b = -10
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
60 - b = -10
\]
Solving for \( b \), we find:
\[
b = 70
\]

The original number of berries is \( r + b = 20 + 70 = 90 \). The original number of raspberries is 20. Therefore, the fraction of the original berries that were raspberries is:
\[
\frac{20}{90} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{2}{9}}

7,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"Nia has four tomato plants with distinct positive integer tomato counts. Their product is 24300. The three plants with the most tomatoes sum to 43, and the three with the fewest sum to 34. Although 5×6×7×8=1680 is close to 24300 when scaled, determine all possible sets of four numbers.","Given four distinct positive integer tomato counts \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(a < b < c < d\), we know the following:
1. The product of the counts is \(abcd = 24300\).
2. The sum of the three plants with the most tomatoes is \(c + d + b = 43\).
3. The sum of the three plants with the fewest tomatoes is \(a + b + c = 34\).

First, we subtract the second equation from the first to find \(d - a\):
\[
(c + d + b) - (a + b + c) = 43 - 34 \implies d - a = 9.
\]
This means \(d = a + 9\). Next, we substitute \(d = a + 9\) into the product equation:
\[
abcd = a(a+9)b(c) = 24300.
\]
We also know from the sum of the three smallest numbers that:
\[
a + b + c = 34.
\]
We need to find integers \(a, b, c\) such that \(a < b < c\) and \(a + b + c = 34\). Let's test possible values for \(a\).

If \(a = 5\), then \(b + c = 29\). We substitute \(a = 5\) into the product equation:
\[
5(5+9)b(c) = 24300 \implies 70bc = 24300 \implies bc = \frac{24300}{70} = 347.14,
\]
which is not an integer.

If \(a = 6\), then \(b + c = 28\). We substitute \(a = 6\) into the product equation:
\[
6(6+9)b(c) = 24300 \implies 114bc = 24300 \implies bc = \frac{24300}{114} = 213.16,
\]
which is not an integer.

If \(a = 7\), then \(b + c = 27\). We substitute \(a = 7\) into the product equation:
\[
7(7+9)b(c) = 24300 \implies 112bc = 24300 \implies bc = \frac{24300}{112} = 217.68,
\]
which is not an integer.

If \(a = 8\), then \(b + c = 26\). We substitute \(a = 8\) into the product equation:
\[
8(8+9)b(c) = 24300 \implies 152bc = 24300 \implies bc = \frac{24300}{152} = 159.21,
\]
which is not an integer.

If \(a = 9\), then \(b + c = 25\). We substitute \(a = 9\) into the product equation:
\[
9(9+9)b(c) = 24300 \implies 162bc = 24300 \implies bc = \frac{24300}{162} = 150.
\]
Now, we need to find integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(b + c = 25\) and \(bc = 150\). We solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 25t + 150 = 0\):
\[
t = \frac{25 \pm \sqrt{25^2 - 4 \cdot 150}}{2} = \frac{25 \pm \sqrt{625 - 600}}{2} = \frac{25 \pm \sqrt{25}}{2} = \frac{25 \pm 5}{2}.
\]
This gives us the solutions \(t = 15\) and \(t = 10\). Therefore, \(b = 10\) and \(c = 15\). Since \(a = 9\), \(d = a + 9 = 18\). We check the conditions:
\[
a + b + c = 9 + 10 + 15 = 34,
\]
\[
c + d + b = 15 + 18 + 10 = 43,
\]
\[
abcd = 9 \cdot 10 \cdot 15 \cdot 18 = 24300.
\]
All conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the only possible set of four numbers is \(\boxed{9, 10, 15, 18}\).",71.802,1087,15.14
8,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"A police car going south at 60 km/h is 0.6 km north of an intersection. A speeding SUV just turned east and is 0.8 km east of the intersection. Radar shows the distance between them increasing at 20 km/h. Many apply Pythagorean theorem directly and get 50 km/h, but what is the actual speed of the SUV?","To determine the actual speed of the SUV, we need to analyze the situation using the Pythagorean theorem and the concept of related rates. Let's denote the position of the police car as \( P \) and the position of the SUV as \( S \). The intersection is at the origin \((0,0)\).

At time \( t = 0 \):
- The police car is 0.6 km north of the intersection, so its position is \( P = (0, 0.6) \).
- The SUV is 0.8 km east of the intersection, so its position is \( S = (0.8, 0) \).

The distance \( D \) between the police car and the SUV at any time \( t \) can be expressed using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ D = \sqrt{(x_S - x_P)^2 + (y_S - y_P)^2} \]
where \( x_S = 0.8 - 60t \) (since the police car is moving south at 60 km/h) and \( y_S = 0 + v_S t \) (where \( v_S \) is the speed of the SUV).

So, the distance \( D \) at time \( t \) is:
\[ D = \sqrt{(0.8 - 60t)^2 + (v_S t)^2} \]

We are given that the distance between them is increasing at a rate of 20 km/h, so:
\[ \frac{dD}{dt} = 20 \]

To find \( v_S \), we need to differentiate \( D \) with respect to \( t \):
\[ D = \sqrt{(0.8 - 60t)^2 + (v_S t)^2} \]
\[ D = \left( (0.8 - 60t)^2 + (v_S t)^2 \right)^{1/2} \]

Using the chain rule, we get:
\[ \frac{dD}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \left( (0.8 - 60t)^2 + (v_S t)^2 \right)^{-1/2} \cdot \left( 2(0.8 - 60t)(-60) + 2(v_S t)(v_S) \right) \]
\[ \frac{dD}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{(0.8 - 60t)^2 + (v_S t)^2}} \cdot \left( -120(0.8 - 60t) + 2v_S^2 t \right) \]
\[ \frac{dD}{dt} = \frac{-120(0.8 - 60t) + 2v_S^2 t}{2\sqrt{(0.8 - 60t)^2 + (v_S t)^2}} \]
\[ \frac{dD}{dt} = \frac{-120(0.8 - 60t) + 2v_S^2 t}{2D} \]
\[ \frac{dD}{dt} = \frac{-96 + 7200t + 2v_S^2 t}{2D} \]
\[ \frac{dD}{dt} = \frac{-96 + (7200 + 2v_S^2)t}{2D} \]

We know that \( \frac{dD}{dt} = 20 \), so:
\[ 20 = \frac{-96 + (7200 + 2v_S^2)t}{2D} \]
\[ 40D = -96 + (7200 + 2v_S^2)t \]

At \( t = 0 \), the distance \( D \) is:
\[ D = \sqrt{(0.8)^2 + (0)^2} = 0.8 \]

Substituting \( D = 0.8 \) and \( t = 0 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 40 \cdot 0.8 = -96 + (7200 + 2v_S^2) \cdot 0 \]
\[ 32 = -96 \]

This is not correct, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. Let's use the correct approach to find the actual speed of the SUV. The correct approach is to use the Pythagorean theorem and the concept of related rates.

The correct approach is to use the Pythagorean theorem and the concept of related rates. The correct answer is:

9,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"With a 4m straight wire, you must form an equilateral triangle with side x and a square with the remainder. Although maximum area seems to occur when x = 1.6 m by intuition, find the exact value of x that maximizes total area.","To find the value of \( x \) that maximizes the total area of an equilateral triangle and a square formed from a 4m straight wire, we start by expressing the side lengths of the triangle and the square in terms of \( x \).

The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is \( 3x \), so the side length of the triangle is \( x \). The perimeter of the square is \( 4 - 3x \), so the side length of the square is \( \frac{4 - 3x}{4} \).

The area of the equilateral triangle is given by the formula:
\[
A_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} x^2
\]

The area of the square is given by the formula:
\[
A_{\text{square}} = \left( \frac{4 - 3x}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{(4 - 3x)^2}{16}
\]

The total area \( A \) is the sum of the areas of the equilateral triangle and the square:
\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} x^2 + \frac{(4 - 3x)^2}{16}
\]

To find the value of \( x \) that maximizes \( A \), we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[
A' = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} x^2 + \frac{(4 - 3x)^2}{16} \right)
\]
\[
A' = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot 2x + \frac{1}{16} \cdot 2(4 - 3x) \cdot (-3)

\[
A' = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} x - \frac{3(4 - 3x)}{8}

\[
A' = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} x - \frac{12 - 9x}{8}

\[
A' = \frac{4\sqrt{3} x - (12 - 9x)}{8}

\[
A' = \frac{4\sqrt{3} x - 12 + 9x}{8}
\]
\[
A' = \frac{(4\sqrt{3} + 9)x - 12}{8}
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:
\[
\frac{(4\sqrt{3} + 9)x - 12}{8} = 0
\]
\[
(4\sqrt{3} + 9)x - 12 = 0
\]
\[
(4\sqrt{3} + 9)x = 12
\]
\[
x = \frac{12}{4\sqrt{3} + 9}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
\[
x = \frac{12}{4\sqrt{3} + 9} \cdot \frac{4\sqrt{3} - 9}{4\sqrt{3} - 9}
\]
\[
x = \frac{12(4\sqrt{3} - 9)}{(4\sqrt{3})^2 - 9^2}

\[
x = \frac{12(4\sqrt{3} - 9)}{48 - 81}

\[
x = \frac{12(4\sqrt{3} - 9)}{-33}

\[
x = -\frac{12(4\sqrt{3} - 9)}{33}

\[
x = \frac{12(9 - 4\sqrt{3})}{33}

\[
x = \frac{4(9 - 4\sqrt{3})}{11}

Many people use tan(40°) ≈ 0.84 and say the nest is 42 feet high, but to the nearest foot, how far above the base is the nest really?","To determine the height of the bird's nest above the base of the tree, we can use trigonometry. Specifically, we will use the tangent function, which relates the angle of elevation to the ratio of the opposite side (the height of the nest) to the adjacent side (the distance from the base of the tree to the cat).

Given:
- The distance from the base of the tree to the cat is 50 feet.
- The angle of elevation to the bird's nest is 40°.
- We are given that \(\tan(40°) \approx 0.84\).

We need to find the height \(h\) of the nest. Using the tangent function, we have:
\[
\tan(40°) = \frac{h}{50}
\]

Substituting the given value of \(\tan(40°)\):
\[
0.84 = \frac{h}{50}
\]

To solve for \(h\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50:
\[
h = 0.84 \times 50
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:
\[
h = 42
\]

Thus, the height of the nest above the base of the tree is 42 feet. Since we are asked to find the height to the nearest foot, and 42 is already a whole number, the final answer is:

\[x^2 - 5x - 14 \leq 0\]

Next, we factor the quadratic expression on the left-hand side. We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-14\) and add up to \(-5\). These numbers are \(-7\) and \(2\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as follows:

\[(x - 7)(x + 2) \leq 0\]

To determine the intervals where this inequality holds, we need to find the roots of the equation \((x - 7)(x + 2) = 0\). The roots are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -2)\), \((-2, 7)\), and \((7, \infty)\).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality \((x - 7)(x + 2) \leq 0\) is satisfied.

1. For the interval \((-\infty, -2)\), we choose \(x = -3\):
   \[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (-3 - 7)(-3 + 2) = (-10)(-1) = 10\]
   Since \(10 > 0\), the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. For the interval \((-2, 7)\), we choose \(x = 0\):
   \[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (0 - 7)(0 + 2) = (-7)(2) = -14\]
   Since \(-14 < 0\), the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

3. For the interval \((7, \infty)\), we choose \(x = 8\):
   \[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (8 - 7)(8 + 2) = (1)(10) = 10\]
   Since \(10 > 0\), the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

We also need to check the endpoints \(x = -2\) and \(x = 7\):
   \[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (-2 - 7)(-2 + 2) = (-9)(0) = 0\]
   \[(x - 7)(x + 2) = (7 - 7)(7 + 2) = (0)(9) = 0\]
   Since \(0 \leq 0\), the inequality is satisfied at both endpoints.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(x^2 - 5x - 4 \leq 10\) is the interval \([-2, 7]\).

The final answer is:

\[\boxed{[-2, 7]}\]",45.326,691,15.25

Many assume the largest sum 29 is the two biggest numbers and guess 12,13,14,17, but what are the four integers in increasing order?","Given four distinct integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) with pairwise sums 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 29, we need to determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) in increasing order.

First, let's assume without loss of generality that \(a < b < c < d\). The largest sum, 29, must be the sum of the two largest numbers, so \(c + d = 29\). The next largest sum, 21, must be the sum of the two second largest numbers, so \(b + d = 21\). The smallest sum, 10, must be the sum of the two smallest numbers, so \(a + b = 10\).

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \(a + b = 10\)
2. \(b + d = 21\)
3. \(c + d = 29\)

We can express \(d\) in terms of \(b\) from the second equation:
\[d = 21 - b\]

We can express \(c\) in terms of \(d\) from the third equation:
\[c = 29 - d = 29 - (21 - b) = 8 + b\]

Now substitute \(d = 21 - b\) and \(c = 8 + b\) into the first equation to find \(a\):
\[a + b = 10\]
\[a = 10 - b\]

We now have expressions for \(a\), \(c\), and \(d\) in terms of \(b\):
\[a = 10 - b\]
\[c = 8 + b\]
\[d = 21 - b\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(b\) such that the remaining sums are 18, 19, and 20. The possible sums are:
\[a + c = (10 - b) + (8 + b) = 18\]
\[a + d = (10 - b) + (21 - b) = 31 - 2b\]
\[b + c = b + (8 + b) = 2b + 8\]
\[b + d = b + (21 - b) = 21\]
\[c + d = (8 + b) + (21 - b) = 29\]

We already know that \(b + d = 21\) and \(c + d = 29\). The remaining sums are 18, 19, and 20. Since \(a + c = 18\), we have:
\[a + c = 18\]

We need to check the values of \(31 - 2b\) and \(2b + 8\) to see which are 19 and 20. Let's solve for \(b\):
\[31 - 2b = 19\]
\[2b = 12\]
\[b = 6\]

Now substitute \(b = 6\) back into the expressions for \(a\), \(c\), and \(d\):
\[a = 10 - 6 = 4\]
\[c = 8 + 6 = 14\]
\[d = 21 - 6 = 15\]

1. **Understand the expression inside the square root:**
   The expression inside the square root is \( x^2 \). For any real number \( x \), \( x^2 \) is always non-negative. Therefore, \( x^2 \geq 0 \).

2. **Apply the square root function:**
   The square root function, \( \sqrt{y} \), is defined for \( y \geq 0 \) and always returns a non-negative value. Therefore, \( \sqrt{x^2} \geq 0 \).

3. **Simplify the expression:**
   For any real number \( x \), \( \sqrt{x^2} = |x| \). The absolute value function \( |x| \) returns the non-negative value of \( x \). This means:
   - If \( x \geq 0 \), then \( |x| = x \).
   - If \( x < 0 \), then \( |x| = -x \).

4. **Determine the range:**
   Since \( |x| \) is always non-negative, the smallest value \( |x| \) can take is 0 (when \( x = 0 \)). As \( x \) increases or decreases without bound, \( |x| \) increases without bound. Therefore, the range of \( f(x) = \sqrt{x^2} = |x| \) is all non-negative real numbers.

In interval notation, the range is \([0, \infty)\).

Thus, the actual range of \( f(x) = \sqrt{x^2} \) is \(\boxed{[0, \infty)}\).",26.243,398,15.17

Many try c = 12 because discriminant 49 − 48 = 1, but list all valid c in decreasing order.","To determine all positive integers \( c \) such that the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \) has rational real roots, we need to ensure that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is a perfect square. The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

For the given equation \( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = c \). Substituting these values into the discriminant formula, we get:

\[
\Delta = (-7)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49 - 4c
\]

For the roots to be rational, \( 49 - 4c \) must be a perfect square. Let \( 49 - 4c = k^2 \) for some integer \( k \). Rearranging this equation, we have:

\[
4c = 49 - k^2
\]

\[
c = \frac{49 - k^2}{4}
\]

Since \( c \) is a positive integer, \( 49 - k^2 \) must be a positive multiple of 4. We need to find all integers \( k \) such that \( 49 - k^2 \) is positive and divisible by 4.

First, let's determine the range of \( k \). Since \( 49 - k^2 > 0 \), we have:

\[
k^2 < 49
\]

\[
-7 < k < 7
\]

Thus, \( k \) can take any integer value from \(-6\) to \(6\). We will check each value of \( k \) to see if \( 49 - k^2 \) is divisible by 4.

### Step 1: Solve \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \)

First, let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Next, solve the quadratic equation \( y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = -21 \):
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2} \]

This gives us two solutions:
\[ y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7 \]

Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we discard \( y = -7 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Substituting back \( y = x^2 \), we get:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts, we obtain:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Step 2: Solve \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \)

Since \( x^4 \geq 0 \) and \( 4x^2 \geq 0 \), the sum \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \). Therefore, \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \) is always true for all real \( x \).

### Step 3: Combine the results

The solution to the original inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) is the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the final answer in interval notation is:

This means we will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms.

Let's start by distributing each term in \(2x^5 + 3x^2\) to each term in \(x^4 - 4x^2 + 3x - 8\):

1. Distribute \(2x^5\):
   \[
   2x^5 \cdot x^4 = 2x^9
   \]
   \[
   2x^5 \cdot (-4x^2) = -8x^7
   \]
   \[
   2x^5 \cdot 3x = 6x^6
   \]
   \[
   2x^5 \cdot (-8) = -16x^5
   \]

2. Distribute \(3x^2\):
   \[
   3x^2 \cdot x^4 = 3x^6
   \]
   \[
   3x^2 \cdot (-4x^2) = -12x^4
   \]
   \[
   3x^2 \cdot 3x = 9x^3
   \]
   \[
   3x^2 \cdot (-8) = -24x^2
   \]

Now, we combine all these products:
\[
2x^9 - 8x^7 + 6x^6 - 16x^5 + 3x^6 - 12x^4 + 9x^3 - 24x^2

\]
\[
2x^9 - 8x^7 + 9x^6 - 16x^5 - 12x^4 + 9x^3 - 24x^2

\]

For the quadratic equation to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

\[
m^2 - 64 > 0
\]

This inequality can be factored as:

\[
(m - 8)(m + 8) > 0
\]

To solve this inequality, we need to determine the intervals where the product \((m - 8)(m + 8)\) is positive. The roots of the equation \((m - 8)(m + 8) = 0\) are \( m = 8 \) and \( m = -8 \). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \( (-\infty, -8) \), \( (-8, 8) \), and \( (8, \infty) \).

We test a point from each interval to determine where the product is positive:

1. For \( m \in (-\infty, -8) \), choose \( m = -9 \):
   \[
   (-9 - 8)(-9 + 8) = (-17)(-1) = 17 > 0
   \]
   So, the product is positive in the interval \( (-\infty, -8) \).

2. For \( m \in (-8, 8) \), choose \( m = 0 \):
   \[
   (0 - 8)(0 + 8) = (-8)(8) = -64 < 0

   So, the product is negative in the interval \( (-8, 8) \).

1. **Determine the slope of the given line:**
   The equation of the given line is \(3x - 7y = 65\). To find the slope, we need to rewrite this equation in slope-intercept form \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the slope.

   Start by isolating \(y\):
   \[

22,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"Many solve |2 − |x|| = 1 by considering only |x| case and get four solutions, but find the sum of squares of all real x satisfying the equation.","To solve the equation \( |2 - |x|| = 1 \), we need to consider the definition of the absolute value function. The equation \( |2 - |x|| = 1 \) means that \( 2 - |x| \) can be either 1 or -1. Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

**Case 1:** \( 2 - |x| = 1 \)
\[
2 - |x| = 1 \implies |x| = 1
\]
The equation \( |x| = 1 \) has two solutions: \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \).

**Case 2:** \( 2 - |x| = -1 \)
\[
2 - |x| = -1 \implies |x| = 3
\]
The equation \( |x| = 3 \) has two solutions: \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -3 \).

Combining the solutions from both cases, we have the four solutions: \( x = 1 \), \( x = -1 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -3 \).

Next, we need to find the sum of the squares of all these solutions:
\[
1^2 + (-1)^2 + 3^2 + (-3)^2 = 1 + 1 + 9 + 9 = 20

Therefore, the sum of the squares of all real \( x \) satisfying the equation is \(\boxed{20}\).",21.908,333,15.2
23,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"A sphere in the first octant is tangent to all three coordinate planes. A point on it has plane distances 50, 29, 41. Although center seems at (50,29,41), find all possible radii.","Given that the sphere is tangent to all three coordinate planes in the first octant, the center of the sphere must be at \((r, r, r)\) where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. A point on the sphere has plane distances 50, 29, and 41, which means the coordinates of this point are \((50, 29, 41)\).

The distance from the center \((r, r, r)\) to the point \((50, 29, 41)\) is equal to the radius \(r\). Therefore, we can write the equation of the distance as:
\[
\sqrt{(50 - r)^2 + (29 - r)^2 + (41 - r)^2} = r
\]
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:
\[
(50 - r)^2 + (29 - r)^2 + (41 - r)^2 = r^2
\]
Expanding the squares, we have:
\[
(2500 - 100r + r^2) + (841 - 58r + r^2) + (1681 - 82r + r^2) = r^2
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
2500 + 841 + 1681 - 100r - 58r - 82r + 3r^2 = r^2
\]
Simplifying the left side, we have:
\[
5022 - 240r + 3r^2 = r^2
\]
Subtracting \(r^2\) from both sides, we get:
\[
5022 - 240r + 2r^2 = 0
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get a standard quadratic equation:
\[
2r^2 - 240r + 5022 = 0
\]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[
r^2 - 120r + 2511 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -120\), and \(c = 2511\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
r = \frac{120 \pm \sqrt{120^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 2511}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{120 \pm \sqrt{14400 - 10044}}{2} = \frac{120 \pm \sqrt{4356}}{2} = \frac{120 \pm 66}{2}
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
r = \frac{120 + 66}{2} = \frac{186}{2} = 93
\]
\[
r = \frac{120 - 66}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27

Therefore, the possible radii of the sphere are \(\boxed{27 \text{ and } 93}\).",50.196,763,15.2
24,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"Many row reduce and think x=1, x=7 are roots because of second row, but find all x such that the determinant with rows [1,1,1], [x,7,−2], [x³,343,−8] is zero.","To find all \( x \) such that the determinant of the matrix with rows \([1,1,1]\), \([x,7,-2]\), and \([x^3,343,-8]\) is zero, we start by writing down the determinant:

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
x & 7 & -2 \\
x^3 & 343 & -8
\end{pmatrix}
\]

We can use cofactor expansion along the first row to compute the determinant:

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
x & 7 & -2 \\
x^3 & 343 & -8
\end{pmatrix} = 1 \cdot \det\begin{pmatrix}
7 & -2 \\
343 & -8
\end{pmatrix} - 1 \cdot \det\begin{pmatrix}
x & -2 \\
x^3 & -8
\end{pmatrix} + 1 \cdot \det\begin{pmatrix}
x & 7 \\
x^3 & 343
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, we compute each of the 2x2 determinants:

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}
7 & -2 \\
343 & -8
\end{pmatrix} = 7 \cdot (-8) - (-2) \cdot 343 = -56 + 686 = 630
\]

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}
x & -2 \\
x^3 & -8
\end{pmatrix} = x \cdot (-8) - (-2) \cdot x^3 = -8x + 2x^3 = 2x^3 - 8x
\]

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}
x & 7 \\
x^3 & 343
\end{pmatrix} = x \cdot 343 - 7 \cdot x^3 = 343x - 7x^3

Substituting these back into the cofactor expansion, we get:

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
x & 7 & -2 \\
x^3 & 343 & -8
\end{pmatrix} = 630 - (2x^3 - 8x) + (343x - 7x^3) = 630 - 2x^3 + 8x + 343x - 7x^3 = 630 + 351x - 9x^3
\]

We need to find the values of \( x \) that make this determinant zero:

\[
630 + 351x - 9x^3 = 0
\]

Rearranging the terms, we get a cubic equation:

\[
-9x^3 + 351x + 630 = 0
\]

We can divide the entire equation by -9 to simplify:

\[
x^3 - 39x - 70 = 0
\]

We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (-70) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (1), which are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 5, \pm 7, \pm 10, \pm 14, \pm 35, \pm 70 \). Let's test \( x = 7 \):

\[
7^3 - 39 \cdot 7 - 70 = 343 - 273 - 70 = 0
\]

So, \( x = 7 \) is a root. We can factor \( x^3 - 39x - 70 \) as \( (x - 7)(x^2 + 7x + 10) \). To verify, we can use polynomial division or synthetic division. Using synthetic division with \( x = 7 \):

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
7 & 1 & 0 & -39 & -70 \\
  &   & 7 & 49 & 70 \\
\hline
  & 1 & 7 & 10 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

The quotient is \( x^2 + 7x + 10 \), so we have:

\[
x^3 - 39x - 70 = (x - 7)(x^2 + 7x + 10)
\]

Next, we factor \( x^2 + 7x + 10 \):

\[
x^2 + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)
\]

So, the complete factorization of the cubic equation is:

\[
x^3 - 39x - 70 = (x - 7)(x + 2)(x + 5)
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the roots:

\[
x - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 7
\]
\[
x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2
\]
\[
x + 5 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -5
\]

Therefore, the values of \( x \) that make the determinant zero are:

25,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"For π ≤ θ < 2π, the infinite series p and q are given with alternating signs and denominators powers of 2. Although partial sum up to cos7θ suggests complex values, given p/q = 2√2 / 7, find sin θ.","Given the infinite series \( p \) and \( q \) with alternating signs and denominators powers of 2, we can express them as follows:
\[ p = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n \frac{\cos(2^n \theta)}{2^n} \]
\[ q = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n \frac{\sin(2^n \theta)}{2^n} \]
We are given that \( \frac{p}{q} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7} \). To find \( \sin \theta \), we start by considering the complex exponential form of the series. Define the complex number \( z \) as:
\[ z = \frac{\cos \theta + i \sin \theta}{2} \]
Then the series \( p + iq \) can be written as:
\[ p + iq = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n z^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-z)^n = \frac{1}{1 + z} \]
This is a geometric series with the first term 1 and common ratio \(-z\). Therefore, we have:
\[ p + iq = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\cos \theta + i \sin \theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{2 + \cos \theta + i \sin \theta}{2}} = \frac{2}{2 + \cos \theta + i \sin \theta} \]
To simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
\[ p + iq = \frac{2(2 + \cos \theta - i \sin \theta)}{(2 + \cos \theta)^2 + \sin^2 \theta} = \frac{4 + 2 \cos \theta - 2i \sin \theta}{4 + 4 \cos \theta + \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta} = \frac{4 + 2 \cos \theta - 2i \sin \theta}{5 + 4 \cos \theta} \]
Thus, we have:
\[ p = \frac{4 + 2 \cos \theta}{5 + 4 \cos \theta} \]
\[ q = \frac{-2 \sin \theta}{5 + 4 \cos \theta} \]
Given that \( \frac{p}{q} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7} \), we substitute the expressions for \( p \) and \( q \):
\[ \frac{\frac{4 + 2 \cos \theta}{5 + 4 \cos \theta}}{\frac{-2 \sin \theta}{5 + 4 \cos \theta}} = \frac{4 + 2 \cos \theta}{-2 \sin \theta} = \frac{2(2 + \cos \theta)}{-2 \sin \theta} = \frac{2 + \cos \theta}{-\sin \theta} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7} \]
This gives us the equation:
\[ 2 + \cos \theta = -\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7} \sin \theta \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 7(2 + \cos \theta) = -2\sqrt{2} \sin \theta \]
\[ 14 + 7 \cos \theta = -2\sqrt{2} \sin \theta \]
\[ 7 \cos \theta + 2\sqrt{2} \sin \theta = -14 \]
To solve for \( \sin \theta \), we use the identity \( \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \). First, we square both sides of the equation \( 7 \cos \theta + 2\sqrt{2} \sin \theta = -14 \):
\[ (7 \cos \theta + 2\sqrt{2} \sin \theta)^2 = (-14)^2 \]
\[ 49 \cos^2 \theta + 28\sqrt{2} \cos \theta \sin \theta + 8 \sin^2 \theta = 196 \]
Using the identity \( \cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta \), we substitute \( \cos^2 \theta \) in the equation:
\[ 49(1 - \sin^2 \theta) + 28\sqrt{2} \cos \theta \sin \theta + 8 \sin^2 \theta = 196 \]
\[ 49 - 49 \sin^2 \theta + 28\sqrt{2} \cos \theta \sin \theta + 8 \sin^2 \theta = 196 \]
\[ 49 - 41 \sin^2 \theta + 28\sqrt{2} \cos \theta \sin \theta = 196 \]
\[ -41 \sin^2 \theta + 28\sqrt{2} \cos \theta \sin \theta = 147 \]
\[ 41 \sin^2 \theta - 28\sqrt{2} \cos \theta \sin \theta = -147 \]
We also know from the equation \( 7 \cos \theta + 2\sqrt{2} \sin \theta = -14 \) that \( \cos \theta = \frac{-14 - 2\sqrt{2} \sin \theta}{7} \). Substituting this into the equation \( 41 \sin^2 \theta - 28\sqrt{2} \cos \theta \sin \theta = -147 \), we get:
\[ 41 \sin^2 \theta - 28\sqrt{2} \left( \frac{-14 - 2\sqrt{2} \sin \theta}{7} \right) \sin \theta = -147 \]

\[ 57 \sin^2 \theta + 56\sqrt{2} \sin \theta + 147 = 0 \]

   The radius \(r\) is the distance from the origin to the point \((0, 3)\). It can be found using the formula:

2. **Determine the angle \(\theta\):**
   The angle \(\theta\) is the angle formed with the positive \(x\)-axis. Since the point \((0, 3)\) lies on the positive \(y\)-axis, the angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). This is because the angle between the positive \(x\)-axis and the positive \(y\)-axis is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

Therefore, the polar coordinates of the point \((0, 3)\) are \((3, \frac{\pi}{2})\).

This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[2\cos^2(\log_{10}(2009)i) + i \sin((15 + \log_{10}(2009))i)\]

Next, we use the properties of logarithms and the fact that the sine and cosine functions can be expressed in terms of complex exponentials. Specifically, we use the identities:

\[\cos(x) = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}\]
\[\sin(x) = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}\]

First, we simplify \(\cos^2(\log_{10}(2009)i)\):

\[= \frac{e^{15i}e^{i\log_{10}(2009)} - e^{-15i}e^{-i\log_{10}(2009)}}{2i}\]

This simplifies to:

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:

   The unit vector in the direction of \( \mathbf{u} \) is \( \mathbf{v} = \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}, \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} \right) \).

2. **Use the reflection formula:**
   The reflection matrix \( R \) over a unit vector \( \mathbf{v} = (a, b) \) is given by:
   \[
   R = 2 \mathbf{v} \mathbf{v}^T - I

\[ \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

First, compute \( M \text{diag}(1,3) \):
\[ M \text{diag}(1,3) = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a & 3b \\ c & 3d \end{pmatrix} \]

Next, compute \( \begin{pmatrix} a & 3b \\ c & 3d \end{pmatrix} M^{-1} \):
\[ \begin{pmatrix} a & 3b \\ c & 3d \end{pmatrix} \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{pmatrix} a & 3b \\ c & 3d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix} \]
\[ = \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{pmatrix} ad - 3bc & -ab + 3ba \\ cd - 3dc & -cb + 3da \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{pmatrix} ad - 3bc & 2ab \\ -2cd & 3da - cb \end{pmatrix} \]

We need this to equal \( \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \), so we set up the following system of equations:
\[ \frac{ad - 3bc}{ad - bc} = 3 \]
\[ \frac{2ab}{ad - bc} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{-2cd}{ad - bc} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{3da - cb}{ad - bc} = 1 \]

From the second equation, \( 2ab = 0 \), so either \( a = 0 \) or \( b = 0 \).
From the third equation, \( -2cd = 0 \), so either \( c = 0 \) or \( d = 0 \).

Since \( ad - bc \neq 0 \) (otherwise \( M \) would not be invertible), we cannot have both \( a = 0 \) and \( c = 0 \), or both \( b = 0 \) and \( d = 0 \). Therefore, we have two cases to consider:

**Case 1: \( a = 0 \) and \( d \neq 0 \)**
Then the equations simplify to:
\[ \frac{-3bc}{-bc} = 3 \implies 3 = 3 \]
\[ \frac{0}{-bc} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{-2cd}{-bc} = 0 \implies \frac{2d}{b} = 0 \implies d = 0 \]
This is a contradiction, so this case is not possible.

**Case 2: \( b = 0 \) and \( c \neq 0 \)**
Then the equations simplify to:
\[ \frac{ad}{ad} = 3 \implies 1 = 3 \]
This is a contradiction, so this case is not possible.

**Case 3: \( a \neq 0 \) and \( c = 0 \)**
Then the equations simplify to:
\[ \frac{ad}{ad} = 3 \implies 1 = 3 \]
This is a contradiction, so this case is not possible.

**Case 4: \( b \neq 0 \) and \( d = 0 \)**
Then the equations simplify to:
\[ \frac{-3bc}{-bc} = 3 \implies 3 = 3 \]
\[ \frac{2ab}{-bc} = 0 \implies \frac{-2a}{c} = 0 \implies a = 0 \]
This is a contradiction, so this case is not possible.

**Case 5: \( a \neq 0 \) and \( d \neq 0 \)**
Then the equations simplify to:
\[ \frac{ad - 3bc}{ad - bc} = 3 \implies ad - 3bc = 3ad - 3bc \implies 0 = 2ad \implies a = 0 \]
This is a contradiction, so this case is not possible.

**Case 6: \( b \neq 0 \) and \( c \neq 0 \)**

**Case 7: \( a \neq 0 \) and \( d \neq 0 \)**
Then the equations simplify to:
\[ \frac{ad - 矛盾 \]

In the xy-plane, the z-coordinate is always zero, so a reflection through the xy-plane will leave the x and y coordinates unchanged and will change the sign of the z-coordinate. However, since we are working in 2D, we only need to consider the x and y coordinates.

The reflection through the xy-plane in 2D can be represented by the matrix:
\[
R = \begin{pmatrix}

First, consider the condition \( \mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} \perp \mathbf{b} \):
\[
(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0
\]
Expanding the dot product, we get:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} + \|\mathbf{b}\|^2 = 0
\]
Rearranging terms, we find:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = -\|\mathbf{b}\|^2
\]

Next, consider the condition \( \mathbf{a} + 2\mathbf{b} \perp \mathbf{a} \):
\[
(\mathbf{a} + 2\mathbf{b}) \cdot \mathbf{a} = 0
\]
Expanding the dot product, we get:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{a} + 2\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 0
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + 2\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0
\]
Substituting \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = -\|\mathbf{b}\|^2\) from the first condition, we get:
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 + 2(-\|\mathbf{b}\|^2) = 0
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 - 2\|\mathbf{b}\|^2 = 0

Rearranging terms, we find:
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\|^2 = 2\|\mathbf{b}\|^2

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

Many set parametric equations equal and solve wrong determinant, find a such that lines never intersect.","To determine the value of \(a\) such that the lines never intersect, we need to find the condition under which the system of equations has no solution. The parametric equations for the two lines are:

Line 1: \((x, y) = (0, 6) + t(4, -6)\)
Line 2: \((x, y) = (1, -7) + u(a, 9)\)

This gives us the following system of equations:
\[x = 4t\]
\[y = 6 - 6t\]
\[x = 1 + au\]
\[y = -7 + 9u\]

We can set the expressions for \(x\) and \(y\) from both lines equal to each other:
\[4t = 1 + au\]
\[6 - 6t = -7 + 9u\]

We now have a system of linear equations in terms of \(t\) and \(u\):
\[4t - au = 1\]
\[-6t - 9u = -13\]

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
4 & -a \\

The determinant of this matrix is:
\[
4(-9) - (-a)(-6) = -36 - 6a

For the system to have no solution, the determinant must be zero:
\[
-36 - 6a = 0

\[

Therefore, the value of \(a\) such that the lines never intersect is \(\boxed{-6}\).",26.353,401,15.22

Although eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 seems (1,1,1), find the true direction vector of line ℓ through origin (integer components, gcd=1, a>0).","To find the true direction vector of the line \(\ell\) through the origin for the given \(3 \times 3\) reflection matrix, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the reflection matrix**: The reflection matrix \(A\) for a plane in 3D space can be written as:
   \[
   A = I - 2\mathbf{n}\mathbf{n}^T
   \]
   where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\mathbf{n}\) is the normal vector to the plane. Given that the matrix has many \(-\frac{2}{3}\) entries, we can infer that the normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}\right)\).

2. **Verify the normal vector**: The normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\) can be verified by checking the form of the reflection matrix:
   \[
   A = I - 2\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{1}{3} \\ \frac{1}{3} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \end{pmatrix} = I - 2 \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} \\ \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} \\ \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{9} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} \frac{2}{9} & \frac{2}{9} & \frac{2}{9} \\ \frac{2}{9} & \frac{2}{9} & \frac{2}{9} \\ \frac{2}{9} & \frac{2}{9} & \frac{2}{9} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{7}{9} & -\frac{2}{9} & -\frac{2}{9} \\ -\frac{2}{9} & \frac{7}{9} & -\frac{2}{9} \\ -\frac{2}{9} & -\frac{2}{9} & \frac{7}{9} \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   This matches the given matrix, confirming that the normal vector is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}\right)\).

3. **Find the direction vector of the line**: The direction vector of the line \(\ell\) through the origin is parallel to the normal vector of the plane. Therefore, the direction vector is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3}\right)\). To express this vector with integer components, we multiply by 3:
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{3} \cdot 3, \frac{1}{3} \cdot 3, \frac{1}{3} \cdot 3\right) = (1, 1, 1)

Many expand arctan x + arccos(y/√(1+y²)) incorrectly, find ordered triple (a,b,c).","To solve the given trig equation \( \arctan x + \arccos\left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{1+y^2}}\right) = \theta \) and simplify it to the form \( xy + ax + by + c = 0 \), we need to find the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

First, let's consider the expression \( \arccos\left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{1+y^2}}\right) \). We know that \( \cos(\arccos z) = z \), so if we let \( \theta = \arccos\left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{1+y^2}}\right) \), then \( \cos \theta = \frac{y}{\sqrt{1+y^2}} \). This implies that \( \sin \theta = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{1+y^2}}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{y^2}{1+y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1+y^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+y^2}} \).

Now, we use the tangent addition formula:
\[ \tan(\arctan x + \arccos\left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{1+y^2}}\right)) = \tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+y^2}}}{\frac{y}{\sqrt{1+y^2}}} = \frac{1}{y}. \]

Since \( \arctan x + \arccos\left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{1+y^2}}\right) = \theta \), we have:
\[ \tan \theta = \tan(\arctan x + \arccos\left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{1+y^2}}\right)) = \frac{x + \frac{1}{y}}{1 - x \cdot \frac{1}{y}} = \frac{xy + 1}{y - x}. \]

However, we need to express this in the form \( xy + ax + by + c = 0 \). Notice that if we set \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), then \( \tan \theta = 1 \), and we have:
\[ 1 = \frac{xy + 1}{y - x}. \]

Rearranging this equation, we get:
\[ y - x = xy + 1, \]
\[ xy + x - y + 1 = 0. \]

Thus, the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are \( 1 \), \( -1 \), and \( 1 \) respectively. Therefore, the ordered triple \((a, b, c)\) is:

This gives us the following system of equations:
1. \( pa + qc = c \)
2. \( pb + qd = d \)
3. \( ra + sc = a \)
4. \( rb + sd = b \)

We need to find \( p, q, r, s \) that satisfy these equations for all \( a, b, c, d \). Let's analyze each equation separately.

From the first equation \( pa + qc = c \), we can see that for this to hold for all \( a \) and \( c \), the coefficient of \( a \) must be 0 and the coefficient of \( c \) must be 1. Therefore, we have:
\[
p = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad q = 1
\]

From the second equation \( pb + qd = d \), substituting \( p = 0 \) and \( q = 1 \), we get:
\[
0 \cdot b + 1 \cdot d = d \implies d = d
\]
This is always true, so it does not provide additional information.

From the third equation \( ra + sc = a \), we can see that for this to hold for all \( a \) and \( c \), the coefficient of \( a \) must be 1 and the coefficient of \( c \) must be 0. Therefore, we have:

1. **Identify the sides of the triangle:**
   - \(MN\) is the opposite side to \(\angle L\).
   - \(LM\) is the adjacent side to \(\angle L\).
   - \(LN\) is the hypotenuse.

2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse \(LN\):**
   The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\(c\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\(a\) and \(b\)). Mathematically, this is expressed as:
   \[
   c^2 = a^2 + b^2
   \]
   Here, \(a = MN = 2\), \(b = LM = \sqrt{21}\), and \(c = LN\). Substituting these values into the Pythagorean theorem, we get:
   \[
   LN^2 = 2^2 + (\sqrt{21})^2

- \(C = a - b\)

The discriminant \(\Delta\) of this quadratic equation is:
\[
\Delta = (2b)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (a - b)

Since these vertices lie on the surface of the hemisphere, they must satisfy the equation of the sphere \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25\). Substituting \(x = \frac{s}{2}\), \(y = \frac{s}{2}\), and \(z = s\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + s^2 = 25
\]
Simplifying the left-hand side, we have:
\[
\frac{s^2}{4} + \frac{s^2}{4} + s^2 = 25
\]
\[
\frac{s^2}{2} + s^2 = 25
\]
\[
\frac{3s^2}{2} = 25
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
3s^2 = 50
\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[
s^2 = \frac{50}{3}
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
s = \sqrt{\frac{50}{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{150}}{3} = \frac{5\sqrt{6}}{3}
\]

Therefore, the maximum side length of the cube inscribed in the upper hemisphere is \(\boxed{\frac{5\sqrt{6}}{3}}\).",36.002,548,15.22
41,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"For π ≤ θ < 2π, the same infinite p/q = 2√2 / 7. Although the pattern repeats every 7 terms suggesting periodicity, find sin θ again (duplicate test of robustness).","Given that \( p/q = 2\sqrt{2} / 7 \) and the pattern repeats every 7 terms, we need to find \( \sin \theta \) for \( \pi \leq \theta < 2\pi \).

First, let's express \( \theta \) in terms of its reference angle. Since \( \pi \leq \theta < 2\pi \), \( \theta \) is in the third or fourth quadrant. The reference angle \( \theta' \) is given by \( \theta' = \theta - \pi \).

The pattern repeats every 7 terms, so we can consider the sequence of angles \( \theta, \theta + \frac{2\pi}{7}, \theta + \frac{4\pi}{7}, \theta + \frac{6\pi}{7}, \theta + \frac{8\pi}{7}, \theta + \frac{10\pi}{7}, \theta + \frac{12\pi}{7} \). Since the pattern repeats every 7 terms, we can focus on the first term in the sequence, which is \( \theta \).

Given \( p/q = 2\sqrt{2} / 7 \), we can express \( \theta \) as \( \theta = \pi + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7} \). The reference angle \( \theta' \) is then \( \theta' = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7} \).

In the third quadrant, the sine of an angle is negative, so \( \sin \theta = -\sin \theta' \). Since \( \theta' = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7} \), we have \( \sin \theta' = \sin \left( \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7} \right) \).

However, since \( \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7} \) is not a standard angle, we need to use the fact that the pattern repeats every 7 terms. This means that \( \sin \theta = -\sin \left( \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7} \right) \).

Given that the pattern repeats every 7 terms, we can use the fact that \( \sin \theta = -\sin \left( \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7} \right) \).

Therefore, the value of \( \sin \theta \) is \( \boxed{-\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7}} \).",36.026,550,15.27

\[
(\cos x + \sin x)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2
\]

This expands to:

\[
\cos^2 x + 2\cos x \sin x + \sin^2 x = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1\), we substitute to get:

\[
1 + 2\cos x \sin x = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we have:

\[
2\cos x \sin x = \frac{1}{4} - 1 = -\frac{3}{4}
\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

\[
\cos x \sin x = -\frac{3}{8}
\]

We know that \(\cos x \sin x = \frac{1}{2} \sin 2x\), so we substitute to get:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \sin 2x = -\frac{3}{8}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2, we find:

\[
\sin 2x = -\frac{3}{4}
\]

Next, we use the double-angle identity for tangent, \(\sin 2x = \frac{2\tan x}{1 + \tan^2 x}\). Substituting \(\sin 2x = -\frac{3}{4}\), we get:

\[
\frac{2\tan x}{1 + \tan^2 x} = -\frac{3}{4}
\]

Cross-multiplying to clear the denominators, we have:

\[
8\tan x = -3(1 + \tan^2 x)
\]

Expanding and rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation in \(\tan x\):

\[
3\tan^2 x + 8\tan x + 3 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 3\), \(b = 8\), and \(c = 3\):

\[
\tan x = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 3}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 36}}{6} = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{28}}{6} = \frac{-8 \pm 2\sqrt{7}}{6} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{7}}{3}
\]

Since \(0^\circ < x < 180^\circ\), \(\sin x\) is positive. We need to determine which value of \(\tan x\) is negative. If \(\tan x = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{7}}{3}\), then \(\sin x\) would be positive and \(\cos x\) would be negative, which is consistent with the original equation \(\cos x + \sin x = \frac{1}{2}\). If \(\tan x = \frac{-4 - \sqrt{7}}{3}\), then \(\sin x\) would be negative, which is not consistent with the original equation.

Therefore, the correct value is \(\tan x = \frac{-4 + \sqrt{7}}{3}\). In this form, \(a = 4\), \(b = 7\), and \(c = 3\). Adding these values together, we get:

\[
a + b + c = 4 + 7 + 3 = 14
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[

43,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"Three points have pairwise distances √9, √16, √25 (i.e., 3-4-5 triangle). Many compute area 6 and determinant squared 144, but find the actual value of that 3×3 determinant squared.","Given three points with pairwise distances \(\sqrt{9}\), \(\sqrt{16}\), and \(\sqrt{25}\), we recognize that these distances form a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5. We need to find the actual value of the square of the determinant of the matrix formed by the coordinates of these points.

Let's place the points in the coordinate plane for simplicity. Assume the points are \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (3, 0)\), and \(C = (x, y)\). The distances between these points are:
- \(AB = 3\)
- \(AC = 5\)
- \(BC = 4\)

Using the distance formula, we can write the following equations:
1. \(AC = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 5 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 25\)
2. \(BC = \sqrt{(x-3)^2 + y^2} = 4 \implies (x-3)^2 + y^2 = 16\)

Expanding the second equation, we get:
\[
(x-3)^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 = 16
\]
Substituting \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\) into the equation, we have:
\[
25 - 6x + 9 = 16 \implies 34 - 6x = 16 \implies 6x = 18 \implies x = 3
\]
Substituting \(x = 3\) back into \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\), we get:
\[
3^2 + y^2 = 25 \implies 9 + y^2 = 25 \implies y^2 = 16 \implies y = 4 \text{ or } y = -4
\]
So, the coordinates of point \(C\) can be either \((3, 4)\) or \((3, -4)\). We will use \((3, 4)\) for our calculations, but the result will be the same for \((3, -4)\).

The matrix formed by the coordinates of the points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
3 & 0 & 1 \\
3 & 4 & 1

\]
The determinant of this matrix is:
\[
\det\begin{pmatrix}

\]
The square of the determinant is:
\[
12^2 = 144
\]
Thus, the actual value of the square of the determinant is \(\boxed{144}\).",47.336,721,15.23
44,Qwen2.5-Math-7B,"Given sin x + cos x = 1/5 and 0 < x < π, many square and get sin 2x term wrong, find tan x.","Given the equation \(\sin x + \cos x = \frac{1}{5}\) and \(0 < x < \pi\), we need to find \(\tan x\).

First, square both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sin x + \cos x)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2
\]
This expands to:
\[
\sin^2 x + 2\sin x \cos x + \cos^2 x = \frac{1}{25}
\]
Using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\), we substitute to get:
\[
1 + 2\sin x \cos x = \frac{1}{25}
\]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[
2\sin x \cos x = \frac{1}{25} - 1 = \frac{1}{25} - \frac{25}{25} = -\frac{24}{25}
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
\sin x \cos x = -\frac{12}{25}
\]
We know that \(\sin 2x = 2\sin x \cos x\), so:
\[
\sin 2x = 2 \left(-\frac{12}{25}\right) = -\frac{24}{25}
\]
Next, we use the identity \((\sin x - \cos x)^2 = \sin^2 x - 2\sin x \cos x + \cos^2 x\). Again, using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\), we substitute to get:
\[
(\sin x - \cos x)^2 = 1 - 2\sin x \cos x = 1 - 2\left(-\frac{12}{25}\right) = 1 + \frac{24}{25} = \frac{49}{25}
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
\sin x - \cos x = \pm \frac{7}{5}
\]
Since \(0 < x < \pi\), \(\sin x\) is positive. We need to determine the sign of \(\cos x\). From \(\sin x + \cos x = \frac{1}{5}\), if \(\cos x\) were positive, then both \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) would be positive, and their sum would be greater than \(\frac{1}{5}\) (since \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) are both less than 1). Therefore, \(\cos x\) must be negative. Thus, we have:
\[
\sin x - \cos x = \frac{7}{5}
\]
Now we have the system of equations:
\[
\sin x + \cos x = \frac{1}{5}
\]
\[
\sin x - \cos x = \frac{7}{5}
\]
Adding these two equations, we get:
\[
2\sin x = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{7}{5} = \frac{8}{5}
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
\sin x = \frac{4}{5}
\]
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
\[
2\cos x = \frac{1}{5} - \frac{7}{5} = -\frac{6}{5}
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
\cos x = -\frac{3}{5}
\]
Finally, we find \(\tan x\):
\[
\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{4}{5}}{-\frac{3}{5}} = -\frac{4}{3}
\]
Thus, the value of \(\tan x\) is:
\[

First, we write down the expression for the multiplication:
\[ i(7 + 2i) \]

Next, we distribute \(i\) to both terms inside the parentheses:
\[ i \cdot 7 + i \cdot 2i \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 7i + 2i^2 \]

We know that \(i^2 = -1\), so we substitute \(-1\) for \(i^2\):
\[ 7i + 2(-1) \]

This further simplifies to:
\[ 7i - 2 \]

Rearranging the terms to match the standard form of a complex number (real part first, then imaginary part), we get:

\[ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{pmatrix} \]

First, we need to find the determinant of \( A \). The determinant of a 2x2 matrix \( \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \) is calculated as:

\[ \det(A) = ad - bc \]

For the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ 1 & 3 \end{pmatrix} \), we have \( a = 2 \), \( b = -1 \), \( c = 1 \), and \( d = 3 \). So, the determinant is:

\[ \det(A) = (2)(3) - (-1)(1) = 6 + 1 = 7 \]

Since the determinant is 7, we can now use the inverse formula. Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) into the formula, we get:

\[ A^{-1} = \frac{1}{7} \begin{pmatrix} 3 & -(-1) \\ -1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{7} \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3}{7} & \frac{1}{7} \\ -\frac{1}{7} & \frac{2}{7} \end{pmatrix} \]

The equation \( |z - 3| = 2 \) represents a circle centered at \( 3 \) with radius \( 2 \), and the equation \( |z + 1| = 4 \) represents a circle centered at \( -1 \) with radius \( 4 \).

First, let's write \( z \) in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let \( z = x + yi \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers. Then the equations become:
\[ |(x + yi) - 3| = 2 \]
\[ |(x + yi) + 1| = 4 \]

These can be rewritten as:
\[ \sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + y^2} = 2 \]
\[ \sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + y^2} = 4 \]

Squaring both sides of each equation, we get:
\[ (x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 4 \]
\[ (x + 1)^2 + y^2 = 16 \]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( y^2 \):
\[ (x + 1)^2 + y^2 - ((x - 3)^2 + y^2) = 16 - 4 \]
\[ (x + 1)^2 - (x - 3)^2 = 12 \]

Expanding the squares, we have:
\[ (x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 6x + 9) = 12 \]
\[ x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2 + 6x - 9 = 12 \]
\[ 8x - 8 = 12 \]
\[ 8x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{8} = \frac{5}{2} \]

Now that we have \( x = \frac{5}{2} \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( y \):
\[ \left( \frac{5}{2} - 3 \right)^2 + y^2 = 4 \]
\[ \left( \frac{5}{2} - \frac{6}{2} \right)^2 + y^2 = 4 \]
\[ \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + y^2 = 4 \]
\[ \frac{1}{4} + y^2 = 4 \]
\[ y^2 = 4 - \frac{1}{4} \]
\[ y^2 = \frac{16}{4} - \frac{1}{4} \]
\[ y^2 = \frac{15}{4} \]

Many solve homogeneous only and get 3ⁿ term, find full closed form.","To find the full closed form of the sequence defined by \(a_1 = 2\) and \(a_{n+1} = 3a_n + 4\), we can use the method of finding a particular solution and a homogeneous solution.

First, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous part of the recurrence relation is:
\[a_{n+1} = 3a_n.\]
The solution to this homogeneous recurrence relation is:
\[a_n = C \cdot 3^n,\]
where \(C\) is a constant.

Next, we need to find a particular solution to the non-homogeneous recurrence relation \(a_{n+1} = 3a_n + 4\). We assume a particular solution of the form \(a_n = A\), where \(A\) is a constant. Substituting \(a_n = A\) into the recurrence relation, we get:
\[A = 3A + 4.\]
Solving for \(A\), we have:
\[A - 3A = 4,\]
\[-2A = 4,\]
\[A = -2.\]
So, a particular solution is \(a_n = -2\).

The general solution to the recurrence relation is the sum of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution:
\[a_n = C \cdot 3^n - 2.\]
To find the value of \(C\), we use the initial condition \(a_1 = 2\). Substituting \(n = 1\) into the general solution, we get:

\[2 = 3C - 2,\]
\[2 + 2 = 3C,\]

We want to express \(\frac{1}{k(k+1)(k+2)}\) in the form \(\frac{A}{k} + \frac{B}{k+1} + \frac{C}{k+2}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{k(k+1)(k+2)} = \frac{A}{k} + \frac{B}{k+1} + \frac{C}{k+2}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(k(k+1)(k+2)\) gives:

\[
1 = A(k+1)(k+2) + Bk(k+2) + Ck(k+1)
\]

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

\[
1 = A(k^2 + 3k + 2) + B(k^2 + 2k) + C(k^2 + k)
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
1 = (A + B + C)k^2 + (3A + 2B + C)k + 2A
\]

For this equation to hold for all \(k\), the coefficients of \(k^2\), \(k\), and the constant term on both sides must be equal. Therefore, we have the following system of equations:

\[
A + B + C = 0
\]
\[
3A + 2B + C = 0
\]
\[
2A = 1

From the third equation, we solve for \(A\):

\[
A = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Substituting \(A = \frac{1}{2}\) into the first equation, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + B + C = 0 \implies B + C = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

Substituting \(A = \frac{1}{2}\) into the second equation, we get:

\[
3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 2B + C = 0 \implies \frac{3}{2} + 2B + C = 0 \implies 2B + C = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

Now we have the system:

\[
B + C = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
2B + C = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

\[
(2B + C) - (B + C) = -\frac{3}{2} - \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \implies B = -1
\]

Substituting \(B = -1\) into \(B + C = -\frac{1}{2}\), we get:

\[
-1 + C = -\frac{1}{2} \implies C = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition is:

\[
\frac{1}{k(k+1)(k+2)} = \frac{1/2}{k} - \frac{1}{k+1} + \frac{1/2}{k+2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{2}{k+1} + \frac{1}{k+2} \right)
\]

The infinite sum is then:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k(k+1)(k+2)} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{2}{k+1} + \frac{1}{k+2} \right)

This is a telescoping series. Writing out the first few terms, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \left( \frac{1}{1} - \frac{2}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{5} \right) + \cdots \right)

Notice that most terms cancel out. The only terms that do not cancel are \(\frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the sum is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}

= x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 - 2x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + x^2 - 2x + 1
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
= x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1
\]

This confirms that \(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1 = (x-1)^4\).

Since \((x-1)^4\) is already factored completely over the reals, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{(x-1)^4}
