2,DeepSeek-Math-7B,Three fair coins are flipped. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 heads?,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of probability and combinations. 

When flipping three coins, there are 8 possible outcomes, since each coin can land in two ways (heads or tails), and there are three coins. These outcomes are: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT.

We are interested in the event of getting exactly 2 heads. This can happen in three ways: HHT, HTH, and THH.

So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. 

In this case, the probability of getting exactly 2 heads is the number of favorable outcomes (3) divided by the total number of outcomes (8).

Now, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that the definite integral of a function from $a$ to $b$ is equal to the antiderivative evaluated at $b$ minus the antiderivative evaluated at $a$.

$\left[\frac{1}{3}x^3\right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3}(1)^3 - \frac{1}{3}(0)^3 = \frac{1}{3} - 0 = \frac{1}{3}$

This rule states that the probability of an event occurring is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not occurring.

In this case, the event not occurring is getting no heads, which is the same as getting all tails. Since each coin has 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails), and there are 3 coins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes in total.

There is only 1 outcome where all 3 coins land on tails, so the probability of getting all tails is 1/8.

Using the complementary probability rule, we can find the probability of getting at least one head:

P(X \ge 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)
P(X \ge 1) = 1 - 1/8

Therefore, S = R^4 is equal to the identity matrix.

The eigenvalues of the identity matrix are 1, as the identity matrix scales any vector by a factor of 1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of S are 1, 1, 1, and 1.",8.559,98,11.45
26,DeepSeek-Math-7B,The function y(x) = x^3 + 1 solves the initial value problem y' = 3x^2 with y(0) = 1. Now consider the differential equation y' = 3(x - 2)^2 with initial condition y(2) = 5. Use a substitution or analogy with the previous solution to find y(x).,"To solve the differential equation y' = 3(x - 2)^2 with the initial condition y(2) = 5, we can use a substitution to make the equation look similar to the previous one.

Let u = x - 2, then x = u + 2.

Now, we can rewrite the differential equation in terms of u:

y'(u) = 3u^2,

and the initial condition becomes y(0) = 5.

This is the same differential equation as the previous one, so we can use the previous solution y(x) = x^3 + 1 and substitute u back in:

y(u) = (u + 2)^3 + 1.

Now, we can substitute x back in:

y(x) = (x - 2 + 2)^3 + 1 = x^3 + 1.

So, the solution to the differential equation y' = 3(x - 2)^2 with the initial condition y(2) = 5 is y(x) = x^3 + 1.",19.773,247,12.49
27,DeepSeek-Math-7B,"Let X be the outcome of a fair six-sided die, so E[X] = 3.5. Define Y = 7 - X. Without recomputing from the distribution, use linearity of expectation or symmetry to compute E[Y].","To compute E[Y], we can use the linearity of expectation, which states that E[Y] = E[7 - X]. 

Since E[X] = 3.5, we can substitute this into the equation:

E[Y] = E[7 - X] = 7 - E[X] = 7 - 3.5 = 3.5

So, E[Y] = 3.5.",7.921,99,12.5
28,DeepSeek-Math-7B,"Let F(x) = \int_0^x (2t + 1) \, dt. Using properties of antiderivatives and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, compute F(1) without performing a full integral from scratch if possible.","To compute F(1), we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that if F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), then \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a).

In this case, f(x) = 2x + 1, and we want to find F(1). We can find an antiderivative of f(x) by integrating:

F(x) = \int (2x + 1) \, dx = x^2 + x + C,

where C is the constant of integration. Since we are given F(x), we can assume that C = 0.

Now, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find F(1):

F(1) = (1^2 + 1) - F(0) = (1 + 1) - 0 = 2.

So, F(1) = 2.",17.902,221,12.35
29,DeepSeek-Math-7B,"A data set consists of the values [1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9] with median 6. A new data set is formed by duplicating each value, so each of the seven numbers now appears twice. Without listing all 14 values explicitly, determine the median of the new data set.","The original data set has 7 values, so the median is the 4th value when the values are arranged in ascending order. The 4th value in the original data set is 6, so the median of the original data set is 6.

When each value is duplicated, the median remains the same. This is because the median is the middle value of the data set, and duplicating a value does not change the position of the middle value.

Therefore, the median of the new data set is also 6.",9.708,113,11.64
